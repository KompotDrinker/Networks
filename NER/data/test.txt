In	1808,	as	the	Russo-Turkish	War	erupted,	Moldavia	was	occupied	by	the	Russian	Empire,	First	Protopope	Lazăr	contacted	Pavel	Chichagov	to	have	his	son	appointed	lieutenant	and	local	head	of	the	Corps	of	Engineers,	but	Gheorghe	Asachi	refused	to	assume	office	or	even	return	from	Vienna.

224	However,	the	aircraft	was	still	in	a	40°	right-hand	bank	when	the	right-most	#4	engine	impacted	into	the	trees	on	top	of	a	ridge	located	NNW	of	Mount	Mikuni	at	an	elevation	of	,	which	can	be	heard	on	the	CVR	recording.	The	backward	shock	of	the	impact,	measuring	0.14G,	in	addition	to	losing	the	thrust	of	the	4th	engine,	caused	the	aircraft	to	bank	sharply	back	to	the	right,	and	the	nose	to	drop	again.

164	For	14	days	in	1901,	Rusk	assisted	Harry	Fielding	Reid	in	mapping	Mount	Adams.	Before	they	began,	they	ascended	Adams	with	two	others,	Nelson	B.	Brooks	and	Dr.	H.	S.	Goddard,	and	then	circled	the	mountain	with	Rusk	leading.	As	they	came	around	the	mountain,	Rusk	suggested	names	for	several	of	the	glaciers.	He	wanted	to	name	Adams	Glacier	as	Reid	Glacier	in	honor	of	Reid;	however,	Reid	insisted	that	it	should	be	named	something	else	because	he	thought	it	improper	to	place	his	own	name	on	the	map	that	he	was	making	and	the	Mazamas	were	trying	to	name	a	glacier	on	Mount	Hood	after	him.	This	eventually	persuaded	Rusk,	but	years	later	when	he	wrote	Tales,	Rusk	repeated	his	wish	that	the	glacier	be	known	as	Reid	Glacier.	Rusk	also	recommended	that	the	Lyman	Glacier	be	named	as	such	in	honor	of	William	Denison	Lyman,	who	had	done	some	to	the	first	research	into	Adams.

As	the	guns	were	out	of	range	of	the	Milan	anti	tank	guided	weapons	of	nearby	2	Para,	their	second	in	command,	Major	Chris	Keeble,	contacted	Capt	J	G	Greenhalgh	of	656	Sqn	AAC	on	the	radio	and	requested	a	helicopter	armed	action	(HELARM)	using	SS.11	missiles	to	attack	them.	As	he	was	engaged	in	ammunition	re-supply,	his	Scout	was	not	fitted	with	missile	booms	-	this	was	to	reduce	weight	and	increase	the	aircraft	lift	capability.	Greenhalgh	then	returned	to	Estancia	House,	where	his	aircraft	was	refuelled,	fitted	out,	and	armed	with	four	missiles	in	20	minutes	with	the	rotors	still	turning.	An	'orders	group'	was	then	held	with	the	crews	of	two	Scouts	of	3	CBAS	and	Captain	Greenhalgh	took	off	on	a	reconnaissance	mission,	while	the	other	aircraft	were	fitted	out	and	readied.	Within	20	minutes,	he	had	located	the	target	and	carried	out	a	detailed	reconnaissance	of	the	area.	He	fired	two	missiles	at	the	enemy	positions	and	then	returned	to	a	pre-arranged	rendezvous	to	meet	up	and	guide	in	the	other	two	Scouts.	The	three	aircraft,	positioned	apart,	then	fired	a	total	of	ten	missiles	(nine	missiles	hit,	one	failed)	from	the	ridge	overlooking	the	Argentine	positions	away	and	succeeded	in	hitting	the	howitzers,	nearby	bunkers,	an	ammunition	dump	and	the	command	post.

135	In	the	Anushasana	Parva	of	the	Mahabharata,	the	god	Shiva	is	described	as	having	cast	a	curse	on	Surabhi.

It	was	that	decided	whoever	found	the	end	of	this	pillar	was	superior.	Brahma	flew	to	the	skies	to	try	to	find	the	top	of	the	pillar,	but	failed.	So	Brahma	forced	Surabhi	(in	some	versions,	Surabhi	instead	suggested	that	Brahma	should	lie)	to	falsely	testify	to	Vishnu	that	Brahma	had	seen	the	top	of	the	linga;	Shiva	punished	Surabhi	by	putting	a	curse	on	her	so	that	her	bovine	offspring	would	have	to	eat	unholy	substances.

These	comprised	two	lines	of	defence,	with	an	outer	bailey	and	two	drum	towers	rather	than	a	central	keep	as	typically	seen	in	other	castles	of	this	period.	The	gatehouse	is	located	in	the	south	east	of	the	building,	and	only	partly	remains.	A	ditch	around	the	outside	of	the	castle	was	cut	from	the	rock	face,	which	is	thought	to	have	once	been	spanned	by	a	pivoting	bridge.	Cilgerran	Castle	is	the	most	northerly	of	all	castles	in	Pembrokeshire.

149	Evans	Notch	(elev.	)	is	a	mountain	pass	located	in	the	White	Mountains	in	Maine,	United	States,	about	east	of	the	New	Hampshire	border.	It	is	the	easternmost	notch	through	the	White	Mountains	(the	next	ones	to	the	west	being	Carter	Notch	and	Pinkham	Notch).	To	the	south,	the	notch	is	drained	by	the	Cold	River,	which	leads	via	the	Charles	River	to	the	Saco	River,	which	in	turn	flows	into	the	Gulf	of	Maine	east	of	Saco	and	Biddeford.	The	Mad	River	is	a	small	mountain	stream	that	joins	the	Cold	River	from	the	west	about	south	of	the	height	of	land,	after	dropping	over	Mad	River	Falls.

His	first	ski	descent	of	Wyoming's	Grand	Teton	on	June	15,	1971	is	regarded	by	most	as	the	single	crystallizing	moment	in	American	big	mountain	skiing.

100	As	the	South	American	plate	collided	with	the	North	American	plate	during	the	late	Paleozoic,	a	major	foreland	basin,	the	Arkoma	Basin,	developed	north	of	the	Ouachita	Mountains.	Small	grains	of	sediment	that	had	filled	the	Arkoma	Basin	were	compacted	and	cemented	into	sedimentary	rock.	As	the	land	rose	above	sea	level,	small	streams	developed	that	eventually	merged	into	the	Arkansas	River.

152	The	ecological	conditions	for	the	settlement	were	extraordinarily	favourable,	because	at	least	two	bountiful	habitats	were	present	for	use:	the	surrounding,	open	oak	forest	and	the	dense	floodplain	forest	of	the	Sarut	as	well	as	the	Orontes	rivers,	flowing	ca.	4	km	west	of	the	settlement.	Water	supply	was	secured	by	the	perennial	Sarut	River.

Turgot	took	fifth	place	in	back-to-back	field	sprints,	in	stages	5	and	6.	After	taking	mountains	points	in	morning	breakaways	in	several	previous	stages,	Charteau	took	the	polka-dot	jersey	after	stage	9,	again	making	the	breakaway.

217	Wau	is	a	town	in	New	Guinea,	in	the	province	of	Morobe	situated	at	one	end	of	the	Wau-Bulolo	Valley.	It	was	the	site	of	a	gold	rush	during	the	1920s	and	1930s.	Gold	prospectors	arrived	at	the	coast	at	Salamaua	and	struggled	inland	along	the	Black	Cat	Track.	The	miners	partially	cleared	the	area	and	built	houses	and	workshops,	and	established	a	water	supply	and	an	electricity	grid.	They	constructed	the	aerodromes	at	Wau	and	Bulolo	which	were	the	primary	means	of	reaching	the	Wau-Bulolo	Valley.	Wau	aerodrome	was	a	rough	Kunai	grass	airstrip	in	length	with	a	10	per	cent	slope	heading	directly	for	Mount	Kaindi.	Aircraft	could	approach	from	the	north	east	only,	landing	uphill	and	taking	off	downhill.	The	mountain	at	the	end	of	the	runway	prevented	second	attempts	at	landing	and	precluded	extension	of	the	strip.	Pilots	had	to	manoeuvre	Dakotas	under	clouds	and	through	dangerous	passes,	dodging	a	peak	here	and	cloud	there,	landing	at	high	speeds.	This	required	good	visibility,	but	the	weather	over	Owen	Stanley	Range	was	characterised	by	frequent	storms,	vertical	drafts,	and	mists	which	rose	from	the	jungle	floor.	The	first	landing	at	Wau	was	made	by	Ernest	Mustard	in	his	De	Havilland	DH.37	on	19	April	1927.

216	History	of	industry	in	Lesser	Poland	goes	back	to	prehistoric	times,	when	in	Świętokrzyskie	Mountains,	first	bloomeries	were	constructed.	In	the	Middle	Ages,	first	plants	were	opened	in	that	area,	and	as	a	result,	Old-Polish	Industrial	Region	was	created,	which	was	a	major	industrial	region	of	the	Polish-Lithuanian	Commonwealth.	In	the	17th	century,	first	Polish	blast	furnaces	were	constructed	in	Samsonów	by	Italian	engineer	Hieronim	Caccio.	Apart	from	iron	products,	used	for	military	purposes,	Old-Polish	Industrial	Region	also	manufactured	charcoal	and	glass.	In	1782,	in	Poland	there	were	34	bloomeries,	out	of	which	27	were	located	in	Old-Polish	Industrial	Region.	Another	major	industrial	area	of	Lesser	Poland	is	Zagłębie	Dąbrowskie,	where	in	the	16th	century,	lead,	silver,	and	zinc	were	found.	As	early	as	in	the	15th	century,	coal	was	exctracted	in	Trzebinia	-	Siersza,	and	in	the	following	centuries,	especially	in	the	19th	century,	several	coal	mines	and	steel	mills	were	opened	in	Zagłębie	and	in	Zagłębie	Krakowskie	(first	coal	mine	in	Jaworzno	was	opened	in	1792).	In	nearby	Olkusz,	the	history	of	zinc	mining	dates	to	the	12th	century	when	Casimir	II	the	Just	set	up	a	mining	settlement.	Also,	in	the	towns	of	Wieliczka	and	Bochnia,	salt	mines	were	established	in	the	12th	and	13th	centuries	(see	Bochnia	Salt	Mine,	Wieliczka	Salt	Mine).	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

210	J.H.	Christie	and	T.	Evans,	the	Town	Clerk	of	Hokitika,	made	a	report	and	assessment	for	the	Public	Works	Department	of	the	proposed	Haast	Pass	road	in	1935.	The	report	sparked	the	new	Labour	Government	to	approve	the	road	from	Bruce	Bay	to	the	Haast	Pass,	and	also	a	road	from	Haast	to	Hollyford	as	part	of	the	same	project.	Christie	said	that	a	road	from	the	Arawhata	River	to	the	Upper	Hollyford	was	estimated	to	cost	£175,000.	By	11	April	advance	workers	on	the	Te	Anau-Milford	Sound	Road	had	reached	the	58-mile	peg,	approximately	from	the	eastern	entrance	to	the	tunnel.	By	November,	preparations	were	complete	for	the	driving	of	a	tunnel	through	the	Homer	Saddle	at	a	height	of	above	sea	level.	The	work	was	expected	to	be	slow	but	uneventful,	with	the	bore	passing	through	scree	at	both	ends	and	solid	granite	in	between.	Power	for	the	work's	12	compressed	air	drills	was	supplied	by	a	hydro-electric	plant	situated	about	six	miles	from	the	scene	of	operations.	Tunnelling	was	all	done	from	the	Southern	end,	as	it	was	impossible	to	transfer	materials	and	plant	to	the	Cleddau	Valley	section.

170	Within	each	square,	eastings	and	northings	from	the	south	west	corner	of	the	square	are	given	numerically.

217	The	Heracleia	(Greek:	Herakleia	en	Kynosargei)	were	ancient	festivals	honoring	the	divine	hero	Heracles.	The	ancient	Athenians	celebrated	the	festival,	which	commemorated	the	death	of	Heracles,	on	the	second	day	of	the	month	of	Metageitnion	(which	would	fall	in	late	July	or	early	August),	at	the	Cynosarges	gymnasium	at	the	demos	Diomeia	outside	the	walls	of	Athens,	in	a	sanctuary	dedicated	to	Heracles.	His	priests	were	drawn	from	the	list	of	boys	who	were	not	full	Athenian	citizens	(nothoi).	Many	famous	nothoi	exercised	there	(such	as	Demosthenes)	but	it	was	probably	not	exclusively	set	aside	for	them.	The	Attic	cults	of	Herakles	were	often	closely	connected	with	youth:	at	several	of	his	cult	sites	there	was	a	gymnasion	attached,	and	there	was	a	mythological	tradition	(perhaps	originating	in	Boeotia)	that	after	Heracles	died	he	was	translated	to	Olympus,	where	he	married	Hebe,	the	personification	of	youth.	Because	of	this	Heracles	is	sometimes	worshipped	as	a	god	and	sometimes	as	a	dead	hero.	In	Thebes,	the	center	of	the	cult	of	Heracles,	the	festivities	lasted	a	number	of	days,	and	consisted	of	various	athletic	and	musical	contests	(agones),	as	well	as	sacrifices.	They	were	celebrated	in	the	gymnasium	of	Iolaus,	the	nephew	and	eromenos	of	Heracles,	and	were	known	as	the	Iolaeia.

181	When	a	sub-aerial	lava	flow	reaches	the	ocean	(or	other	large	body	of	water),	contact	with	the	water	causes	both	rapid	cooling	of	the	lava	and	steam	explosions	that	fragment	it.	The	glassy	fragments	that	are	formed,	known	as	hyaloclastites,	fall	down	to	the	seabed	forming	foresets.	As	the	seabed	topography	becomes	infilled,	the	subaerial	flow	is	able	to	build	out.	The	process	continues	as	long	as	the	lava	supply	is	maintained,	creating	a	lava	bench.	A	lava	bench	is	a	volcanic	landform	with	a	horizontal	surface	raised	above	the	level	of	the	surrounding	area.	The	Hawaiian	islands	are	an	example	of	land	that	was	formed	this	way,	and	the	Big	Island	is	currently	still	expanding	due	to	lava	benches.

195	Dotsero	was	an	important	railroad	junction	point	for	the	Denver	and	Rio	Grande	Western	Railroad's	Denver	to	Salt	Lake	City	line.	Originally	the	line	passed	through	Dotsero	following	the	Eagle	River	towards	Tennessee	Pass	and	through	the	Royal	Gorge	of	the	Arkansas	River	en	route	to	Pueblo,	Colorado	before	turning	north	towards	Denver.	Through	the	years,	efforts	were	made	to	have	a	more	direct	connection	between	Denver	and	Salt	Lake	that	did	not	require	detouring	through	Pueblo.	The	Denver	and	Salt	Lake	Railroad	(D&SL)	built	a	line	west	from	Denver	and	entered	the	Colorado	River	canyon	near	Bond,	Colorado,	about	Northeast	of	Dotsero.	The	D&SL	was	never	finished	as	a	separate	route	to	Salt	Lake	City;	however,	was	eventually	acquired	by	the	D&RGW,	who	built	a	connection	between	Dotsero	and	Orestod	(Dotsero	spelled	backwards)	near	Bond.	This	connection,	commonly	known	as	the	Dotsero	Cutoff,	was	completed	on	June	15,	1934	and	finally	provided	Denver	with	a	direct	link	to	Salt	Lake	City,	making	Dotsero	the	junction	between	the	old	and	new	routes	to	Denver.

249	The	fantasy	setting	of	The	Magic	of	Scheherazade	borrows	from	Middle	Eastern	folk	tales	in	One	Thousand	and	One	Nights.	Many	years	prior	to	the	opening	of	the	game,	the	land	of	Arabia	was	taken	over	by	the	malevolent	demon	Goragora	and	his	army	of	minions.	A	magician	named	Isfa,	harnessing	the	power	of	the	blue	star	Airosche,	vanquished	the	demons	and	sealed	them	underground.	Peace	briefly	returned	until	the	evil	wizard	Sabaron	freed	Goragora	and	the	demons	from	their	captivity	and	imprisoned	the	Arabian	princess	Scheherazade	and	her	family.	The	player	takes	on	the	role	of	Isfa's	unnamed	descendant,	who	unsuccessfully	attempts	to	save	his	lover	Scheherazade	from	Sabaron.	As	a	result,	the	player	character's	memories	are	erased,	his	magical	powers	are	sealed,	and	he	is	thrust	into	a	different	time	period.	He	is	quickly	greeted	by	the	cat-like	spirit	Coronya,	who	possesses	the	ability	to	open	a	passage	to	travel	through	time.	With	this,	the	amnesic	hero	is	able	to	traverse	five	worlds	in	order	to	regain	his	memories,	learn	new	magic,	recruit	several	allies,	and	defeat	the	demon	overlords.	Once	Scheherazade's	three	sisters	and	father	are	rescued,	the	protagonist	confronts	Sabaron,	who	realizes	releasing	Goragora	was	a	mistake.	The	hero	then	goes	to	the	Dark	World	and	destroys	Goragora,	returning	tranquility	to	Arabia	once	again.	After	being	thanked	by	Scheherazade	and	her	family,	the	hero	promises	to	return	to	his	beloved	someday	as	he	and	his	party	depart	on	a	magic	carpet	toward	their	next	adventure.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

147	Shortly	after	the	nationalisation	of	the	WMR	line,	the	Napier	Express	was	diverted	from	the	Wairarapa	Line	to	run	through	the	Manawatu	Gorge	and	down	the	former	WMR	line	to	Wellington.	Thereafter,	the	main	passenger	service	to	stop	at	Pahiatua	was	its	replacement,	the	Wairarapa	Mail.	A	new	passenger	service	was	provided	from	1936	with	the	introduction	of	the	Wairarapa-class	railcars,	which	supplemented	and	later	replaced	the	Wairarapa	Mail	in	1948.	The	Wairarapa	railcars	were	replaced	after	the	opening	of	the	Rimutaka	Tunnel	in	1955	by	88-seater	twinset	railcars,	which	provided	the	main	passenger	service	for	Pahiatua	for	the	next	22	years.

133	In	1902,	a	fire	swept	through	one	of	the	mills,	completely	destroying	it	as	well	as	the	town.	Both	were	soon	rebuilt	in	new	locations.	This	event	is	often	heralded	as	the	start	of	the	decline	of	the	large-scale	Victorian	logging	practices,	which	were	replaced	by	more	modern	techniques.

In	1928,	the	United	States	Forest	Service	began	reforesting	the	slopes	of	Larch	Mountain,	so	that	more	lumber	could	be	produced.	A	fire	in	1936	marked	the	end	of	the	timber	business	on	the	mountain.	Causing	around	$100,000	of	damage,	it	severely	damaged	the	lumber	mill,	which	was	not	rebuilt	due	to	the	depletion	of	the	timber	supply	on	the	mountain.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

232	The	history	of	E.	annectens	predates	both	Edmontosaurus	and	annectens.	The	first	good	specimen,	the	former	holotype	(specimen	on	which	a	taxonomic	name	is	based)	of	Anatosaurus	copei	(Anatotitan),	was	a	complete	skull	and	most	of	a	skeleton	collected	in	1882	by	Dr.	J.	L.	Wortman	and	R.	S.	Hill	for	American	paleontologist	Edward	Drinker	Cope.	This	specimen,	found	in	Hell	Creek	Formation	rocks,	came	from	northeast	of	the	Black	Hills	of	South	Dakota	and	originally	had	extensive	skin	impressions.	It	was	missing	most	of	the	pelvis	and	part	of	the	torso	due	to	a	stream	cutting	through	it.	The	bill	had	impressions	of	a	horny	sheath	with	a	tooth-like	series	of	interlocking	points	on	the	upper	and	lower	jaws.	When	describing	this	specimen	AMNH	5730,	Cope	assigned	it	to	the	species	Diclonius	mirabilis.	This	species	name	was	created	by	combining	Diclonius,	a	hadrosaurid	genus	Cope	had	named	earlier	from	teeth,	with	Trachodon	mirabilis,	an	older	name	based	on	teeth	and	published	by	Joseph	Leidy.	Cope	believed	that	Leidy	had	failed	to	properly	characterize	the	genus	Trachodon	and	later	abandoned	its	use,	so	he	assigned	the	old	species	to	his	newer	genus.	Leidy	had	come	to	recognize	that	his	Trachodon	was	based	on	the	remains	of	multiple	kinds	of	dinosaurs,	and	though	he	had	made	some	attempts	to	revise	the	genus,	he	had	not	yet	made	any	formal	declaration	of	his	intentions.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

179	The	imperial	woodpecker's	typical	size	ranges	from	.	The	male	imperial	woodpecker	has	a	red-sided	crest,	centered	black,	but	otherwise	mostly	black,	with	large	white	wing-patch,	thin	white	braces	on	its	mantle	and	a	huge	ivory-colored	bill.	They	are	all	black	except	for	the	inner	primaries,	which	are	white-tipped,	the	white	secondaries,	and	a	white	scapular	stripe	which,	unlike	the	ivory-billed	woodpecker,	does	not	extend	onto	the	neck.	The	female	is	similar,	but	her	crest	is	all	black	and	(unlike	the	female	ivorybill)	recurved	at	the	top,	lacking	any	red.	Much	larger	than	any	other	sympatric	woodpecker,	it	is	the	only	woodpecker	in	the	area	with	solid	black	underparts.	Its	voice	is	reportedly	toy	trumpet-like.	The	bird	was	once	widespread	and,	until	the	early	1950s,	not	uncommon	throughout	the	Sierra	Madre	Occidental	of	Mexico,	from	western	Sonora	and	Chihuahua	southwards	to	Jalisco	and	Michoacán.

341	The	Karimun	Regency	has	several	dialects	namely	the	Kundur	dialect	and	the	Bintan-Karimun	dialect.	In	general,	it	uses	the	Johor-Riau	dialect.	The	main	characteristic	of	this	dialect	is	the	suffix	A	which	sounds	as	E.	The	word	/saya/	and	/apa/	(I	and	What	respectively)	will	be	pronounced	as	/saye/	and	/ape/	in	the	Johor-Riau	dialect,	which	is	similar	to	the	Malay	used	in	Peninsular	Malaysia.	The	dialects	used	in	the	Bintan	Regency	are	the	Bintan-Karimun	dialect,	the	Malang	Rapat-Kelong	dialect	which	is	used	in	Malang	Rapat	village	and	Kelong	village	and	the	Mantang	Lama	dialect	in	Mantang	Lama	Village	in	Kijang.	The	word	pronunciation	is	similar	to	the	Malay	used	in	Tanjung	Pinang	and	Karimun.	The	Malay	used	in	the	Lingga	Regency	is	also	similar	to	the	Malay	used	in	the	Karimun	and	BIitan	Regency.	The	variety	of	Malay	spoken	in	the	province's	northernmost	regencies,	Anambas	and	Natuna,	is	not	only	mutually	unintelligible	to	the	standard	Indonesian	language,	but	also	mutually	unintelligible	to	the	Malay	varieties	spoken	in	Bintan	and	Karimun.	The	Anambas	Malay	dialect	slightly	resembles	the	Pontianak	Malay	dialect	spoken	in	West	Kalimantan	and	the	Belitung	Malay	dialect	spoken	in	Bangka-Belitung,	especially	their	vocabulary	and	phonology.	For	example,	kitak	or	ketak	which	means	you,	wan	which	means	grandma	and	suduk	which	means	spoon	are	both	used	in	Anambas	and	Pontianak.	The	Natuna	Malay	people	spoke	a	dialect	of	Malay	that	is	influenced	by	Terengganu	Malay	and	Pahang	Malay	that	are	spoken	in	the	Malaysian	states	of	Terengganu	and	Pahang	respectively,	as	most	of	the	people	living	there	trace	their	origins	from	the	eastern	coast	of	the	Malay	Peninsula.	Historically,	the	Anambas	and	Natuna	Malays	spoke	the	Terengganu	Malay,	but	its	speakers	(mostly	elderly)	are	rapidly	diminishing	and	replaced	by	the	local	Malay	dialects	on	the	islands	(to	a	lesser	extent,	the	usage	of	standard	Indonesian	was	also	the	cause	of	the	diminishment	of	native	dialect	speakers).

160	The	grapes	available	at	the	time,	of	the	Mission	variety,	were	brought	to	Alta	California	by	the	Franciscan	Brothers	at	the	end	of	the	18th	century.	They	grew	well	and	yielded	large	quantities	of	wine,	but	Jean-Louis	Vignes	was	not	satisfied	with	the	results.	Therefore,	he	decided	to	import	better	vines	from	Bordeaux,	Cabernet	Franc	and	Sauvignon	blanc.	The	vines	transited	around	Cape	Horn.	To	preserve	their	roots	during	the	long	trip,	they	were	inserted	in	moss	and	potato	slices.	Vignes	became	the	first	Californio	who	grew	quality	vines,	and	the	first	who	aged	his	wines.	The	common	practice	at	the	time	was	to	drink	the	wine	as	soon	as	it	was	fermented.	The	exact	date	of	his	first	vintage	is	unknown.

Although	many	species	of	the	cat	family	mentioned	in	the	Bible	had	long	disappeared	from	the	region,	Shulov	was	able	to	import	several	big	cats,	and	brought	the	first	lion	to	the	zoo.	Professor	Shulov	served	as	the	director	of	the	Zoo	for	43	years,	until	his	retirement.	The	zoo,	now	known	as	the	Tisch	Family	Zoological	Gardens,	has	developed	into	an	internationally	renowned	zoo	and	research	facility,	and	popular	tourist	destination.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

151	The	area	of	modern-day	Saudi	Arabia	formerly	consisted	of	mainly	four	distinct	regions:	Hejaz,	Najd	and	parts	of	Eastern	Arabia	(Al-Ahsa)	and	Southern	Arabia	('Asir).	The	Kingdom	of	Saudi	Arabia	was	founded	in	1932	by	Ibn	Saud.	He	united	the	four	regions	into	a	single	state	through	a	series	of	conquests	beginning	in	1902	with	the	capture	of	Riyadh,	the	ancestral	home	of	his	family,	the	House	of	Saud.	Saudi	Arabia	has	since	been	a	totalitarian	absolute	monarchy,	effectively	a	hereditary	dictatorship	governed	along	Islamist	lines.	The	ultraconservative	Wahhabi	religious	movement	within	Sunni	Islam	has	been	called	the	predominant	feature	of	Saudi	culture,	with	its	global	spread	largely	financed	by	the	oil	and	gas	trade.

While	it	stands	in	relative	isolation,	it	is	linked	to	Peel	Fell	by	a	ridge	of	high	ground,	and	so	forms	a	northern	projection	of	the	Cheviot	Hills	which	straddle	the	Anglo-Scottish	border.	It	stands	on	the	south	bank	of	the	River	Teviot	and	forms	a	conspicuous	landmark	from	much	of	Teviotdale.	It	rises	to	424	m	and	has	a	prominence	of	196	m	above	the	col	to	its	south.

160	As	mentioned	earlier,	the	majority	of	the	people	who	climb	Dove	Crag	do	so	from	Ambleside	as	part	of	the	Fairfield	horseshoe	walk.	However,	the	ascent	from	Patterdale	gives	the	walker	the	opportunity	to	explore	the	relatively	unknown	valley	of	Dovedale	and	the	beck	which	flows	down	it	and	to	study	the	crags	of	the	fell.	It	is	believed	that	the	upper	part	of	Dovedale	was	once	the	crater	of	a	volcano.	The	ascent	from	Patterdale	starts	from	the	car	park	at	Brothers	Water	and	takes	the	path	to	Hartsop	Hall.

203	The	extensive	spruce	forests	in	the	area	surrounding	the	Fichtelberg	have	been	constantly	utilised	since	man	first	settled	here	and	have	thus	undergone	much	change.	The	original	vegetation	of	the	highlands	and	mountain	ridges	was	fundamentally	different.	Pollen	analyses	from	the	Gottesgaber	Moor	revealed	useful	information	about	the	former	composition	of	the	forest.	The	main	tree	species	of	the	Hercynian	mixed	forest	of	the	highlands	-	the	silver	fir	(Abies	alba),	European	beech	(Fagus	sylvatica)	and	Norway	spruce	(Picea	abies)	-	occurred	in	roughly	equal	proportions	of	around	30%	on	the	ridgelines.	Old	church	records	and	forest	assessments	contain	descriptions	of	the	original	condition	of	the	forest,	showing	that	the	Fichtelberg	was	covered	by	mixed	forest	consisting	of	the	aforementioned	tree	species.	The	present	dominance	of	the	spruce	is	primarily	a	result	of	human	influence.	Improper	management	such	as	deforestation	and	high	populations	of	game	steadily	reduced	the	proportion	of	fir	and	beech	trees	in	favour	of	spruce.	With	the	beginning	of	state	forestry	in	Saxony	in	the	early	19th	century,	the	composition	of	species	changed	drastically.	Forest	management,	which	was	focussed	on	achieving	the	highest	net	yield,	saw	the	spruce	as	the	perfect	timber	resource.

162	However,	as	World	War	II	progressed,	the	United	States	began	to	believe	that	Saudi	oil	was	of	strategic	importance.	As	a	result,	in	the	interest	of	national	security,	the	U.S.	began	to	push	for	greater	control	over	the	CASOC	concession.	On	16	February	1943,	President	Franklin	D.	Roosevelt	declared	that	the	defense	of	Saudi	Arabia	is	vital	to	the	defense	of	the	United	States,	thereby	making	possible	the	extension	of	the	Lend-Lease	program	to	the	kingdom.	Later	that	year,	the	president	approved	the	creation	of	the	state-owned	Petroleum	Reserves	Corporation,	with	the	intent	that	it	purchase	all	the	stock	of	CASOC	and	thus	gain	control	of	Saudi	oil	reserves	in	the	region.	However,	the	plan	was	met	with	opposition	and	ultimately	failed.

158	The	most	notable	armored	trains	of	the	First	World	War	were	the	armored	rail-cruisers	built	by	Russia	and	Austria-Hungary.	These	rail	cars	were	self-propelled	and	fitted	with	turreted	weapons,	thus	resembling	railroad	tanks.	One	such	Austro-Hungarian	rail-cruiser	was	built	in	1916.	Dubbed	the	Motorkanonwagen	(motorized	gun	car),	it	was	the	most	futuristic	of	the	Austro-Hungarian	armored	rail-cruisers,	armed	with	a	fully-rotating	turret	fitted	with	a	70	mm	Škoda	gun.

173	Despite	being	an	Assyrian	himself,	Shamash-shum-ukin,	after	decades	subject	to	his	brother	Ashurbanipal,	declared	that	the	city	of	Babylon	(and	not	the	Assyrian	city	of	Nineveh)	should	be	the	seat	of	the	immense	empire.	He	raised	a	major	revolt	against	his	brother,	Ashurbanipal.

After	a	bitter	struggle	Babylon	was	sacked	and	its	allies	vanquished,	Shamash-shum-ukim	being	killed	in	the	process.	Elam	was	destroyed	once	and	for	all,	and	the	Babylonians,	Persians,	Chaldeans,	Arabs,	Medes,	Elamites,	Arameans,	Suteans	and	Canaanites	were	violently	subjugated,	with	Assyrian	troops	exacting	savage	revenge	on	the	rebelling	peoples.	An	Assyrian	governor	named	Kandalanu	was	placed	on	the	throne	to	rule	on	behalf	of	the	Assyrian	king.

133	The	Alpine	ibex	historically	ranged	through	France,	Italy,	Switzerland,	Liechtenstein,	Bavaria,	Austria	and	Slovenia.	Starting	in	the	early	16th	century	and	with	firearms	becoming	common,	the	overall	population	declined	due	to	overexploitation	and	poaching.

109	Vaikuntha	generally	refers	to	Vishnu's	abode,	but	in	the	Mahabharata	and	the	Puranas,	this	term	is	also	used	as	an	epithet	of	Vishnu.	Though	no	clear	etymology	of	vaikuntha	exists,	the	term	is	believed	to	be	derived	from	vi-kuntha,	literally	meaning	not	blunt.	The	earliest	scriptures	like	the	Vedas,	Upanishads	and	Brahmanas	connect	the	epithet	to	Indra,	the	king	of	the	gods	and	the	Supreme	god	of	the	era.

191	The	king	of	gods,	Indra,	was	infatuated	with	her	beauty	and	comes	disguised	as	Gautama,	when	the	sage	was	away	and	requests	or	orders	sexual	intercourse.	In	the	Ramayana	(the	earliest	full	narrative	of	the	tale),	Ahalya	sees	through	his	disguise,	but	still	complies	out	of	curiosity.

The	central	part	of	the	IBA,	at	an	altitude	of	3600-4000	m,	contains	two	lakes,	Rangkul	and	Shorkul,	which	form	an	endorheic	system	and	are	connected	by	the	Izyuk	channel.	Rangkul	is	a	freshwater	lake	with	an	area	of	8	km2	and	a	depth	of	6	m.	Shorkul	is	brackish;	it	has	an	area	of	7	km2.	Both	lakes	freeze	in	winter	and	contain	no	fish,	but	support	numerous	invertebrates,	including	amphipods,	beetles	and	mosquito	larvae.

255	The	Dashavatara	Temple	or	Gupta	Temple,	built	in	400-500	AD,	is	one	of	the	oldest	Hindu	temple	that	is	still	existent	until	modern	era.	The	temple	dedicated	to	god	Vishnu,	was	first	discovered	by	Captain	Charles	Strahan.	It	was	given	its	name	by	the	archaeologist,	Cunnigham.	Archaeologists	have	inferred	that	it	is	the	earliest	known	Panchayatana	temple	in	North	India.	It	was	subsequently	renamed	by	Cunningham	as	Dashavatara	Mandir	or	Dashavatara	Temple	(because	the	temple	depicts	ten	incarnations	of	Vishnu),	and	also	as	Sagar	Marh	(meaning:	the	temple	by	the	well).	It	was	the	first	North	Indian	temple	with	a	shikhara	or	tower,	although	the	shikhara	is	curtailed	and	part	of	it	has	disappeared.	The	temple	has	a	high	plinth	and	is	set	with	a	basement	porch.	The	Dashavatara	temple	has	a	compelling	presence	in	spite	of	its	dilapidated	condition.	Sculpted	panels	are	seen	on	the	terraced	basement,	with	carved	figurines	of	river	goddesses	Ganga	and	Yamuna	flanking	the	doorway	to	the	sanctum	sanctorum.	In	addition,	on	the	side	walls,	three	large	carved	panels	of	Vaishnava	mythology	related	to	Gajendra	Moksha,	the	Nara	Narayana	Tapasya	(austerities),	and	the	Sheshashayi	Vishnu	(reclining	on	the	serpent),	are	portrayed.	A	protective	wall	made	of	undressed	stone	was	built	around	the	temple	after	it	was	first	discovered.	However,	the	idol	of	the	sanctum	sanctorum	of	the	temple	is	missing,	believed	to	have	been	relocated	elsewhere.	The	ancient	treatise	Vishnudharmottara	Purana	describes	several	temples	including	a	Sarvatobhadra	temple,	which	has	been	identified	by	archaeologists	and	Indologists	with	the	Dashavatara	Temple.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The	cave-in	stimulated	public	awareness	of	the	potential	threat	mining	places	to	the	rich	scientific,	tourism	and	ecological	heritage.	Ecologists	and	speleologists	pressured	the	Government	of	Meghalaya	to	take	effective	steps	to	stop	limestone	mining	in	the	vicinity	of	the	limestone	caves	in	the	state.	During	the	mid	1990s,	a	cement	plant	was	planned	close	to	the	Siju	Cave	(called	the	Bat	Cave),	near	Balphakram	National	Park	in	the	Garo	Hills.

The	political	vacuum	and	frequent	revolts	paved	the	way	for	the	Kilab	to	strengthen	their	influence	in	northern	Syria.	Sometime	during	the	9th	century,	a	second	major	wave	of	Kilabi	tribesmen,	likely	from	the	'Amr	division,	migrated	to	the	area	from	Arabia.

105	Following	the	Meiji	Restoration	in	1868,	the	Japanese	government	dissolved	the	pattern	of	Shintō-Buddhist	amalgamation	and	Shintō	was	selected	as	the	official	state	religion.	Shugendō	was	adversely	affected	by	this	split	and	many	shugendō	priests	returned	to	a	secular	life.	Following	the	end	of	World	War	II	however,	shugendō	was	allowed	to	enjoy	a	status	as	a	minor	religious	group.

151	In	1975	retired	geologist	and	researcher	Christian	O'Brien	suggested	that	Portingbury	Hills	had	a	purpose	in	archaeoastronomy	and	was	constructed	in	the	Bronze	Age	which	gave	it	some	brief	coverage	in	the	Sunday	Telegraph.	O'Brien	suggested	that	the	mound	was	aligned	astronomically	with	Wandlebury	Hill	via	a	series	of	equally	spaced,	hand-carved,	stone	monoliths	forming	a	Loxodrome.	Eleven	of	the	original	twenty-six	markers	are	still	in	situ,	such	as	the	Leper	Stone,	with	several	of	the	other	distinctive	stones	lying	nearby.

127	Transhumance	is	an	ancient	Italian	custom,	today	scarcely	surviving,	by	which	large	flocks	of	sheep	in	the	mid	fall	were	driven	south	from	the	hilly	and	mountainous	regions	of	the	Apennines	to	winter	over	in	the	more	southern	coastal	plains	of	Apulia	and,	less	commonly,	Lazio.	A	much	more	limited	version	of	these	migrations	took	place	in	the	Alpine	and	Prealpine	areas	of	Valle	d'Aosta,	Lombardy	and	Piedmont.

220	The	wooden	watchtower	on	the	top	of	the	Lis'ya	mountain	was	established	in	the	18th	century.	In	the	early	19th	century	it	was	replaced	with	the	stone	watchtower.	According	to	one	of	the	far-fetched	version	it	had	been	intended	to	protect	local	population	from	the	nomads.	But	corresponding	to	more	realistic	version	it	served	as	a	fire	lookout	tower.	There	are	also	versions	that	the	tower	was	used	as	an	observatory	or	even	as	a	kind	of	lighthouse.	Unfortunately,	author	of	the	tower	project	is	unknown.	However,	on	the	cast	iron	plate	that	secures	one	of	the	side	of	the	tower	you	can	find	date	of	the	construction:	1818.	The	tower	has	been	used	as	the	fire	lookout	tower:	In	the	event	of	a	fire	towers	watchmen	rang	the	alarm	bronze	bell	and	warned	town	residents	by	hanging	out	the	red	lights	made	of	big	leather	bags.	In	the	mid-1830s	near	the	watchtower	an	observatory	was	established	for	observing	Halley's	Comet	(visible	from	Earth	from	1835	to	1836).	This	observatory	was	a	pavilion	placed	on	the	rotating	platform.	Nowadays,	the	only	part	of	the	observatory	that	survived	is	the	bulky	cast	iron	pedestral	buried	in	the	rock.

180	Near	the	end	of	the	Pleistocene,	between	12,000	and	17,000	years	ago,	a	massive	landslide	occurred	within	the	Tonquin	Valley	in	the	Rocky	Mountains	of	central	western	Alberta.	This	landslide	deposited	millions	of	tonnes	of	beige	to	pinkish	quartzite	and	quartzitic	conglomerate	of	the	Gog	Group	onto	the	top	of	a	valley	glacier.	This	mass	of	quartzite	and	quartzitic	conglomerate	was	carried	eastward	by	this	valley	glacier.	After	leaving	its	valley	within	the	Rocky	Mountains,	this	valley	glacier	coalesced	with	other	valley	glaciers	to	form	part	of	the	Cordilleran	Ice	Sheet.	The	former	valley	glacier	as	part	of	this	ice	sheet	collided	with	the	Laurentide	Ice	Sheet	and	it	and	the	erratics	of	quartzite	and	quartzitic	conglomerate	were	diverted	southward	along	the	boundary	between	these	two	ice	sheets.

311	Arctica	Islandica	shows	slower	growth	rate	than	other	species	of	clams,	it	takes	an	average	rate	of	4-days	for	birth	(embryo	to	larvae	stage).	Furthermore	it	takes	an	average	of	5.8-years	for	the	A.	Islandica	to	reach	maturity,	at	this	point	the	somatic	costs	start	going	down.	Dynamic	Energy	Models	(DEM)	predict	that	Arctica	islandica's	extreme	longevity	arises	from	a	lowered	somatic	maintenance	costs	and	a	low	aging	acceleration.	For	individuals	in	populations	in	cold	areas	the	growth	rate	is	probably	further	slowed	because	growth	only	occurs	in	summer.	This	slow	life	style	results	in	exceptional	longevity	with	a	highest	reported	age,	for	Ming	the	clam,	of	507	years.	This	makes	it	the	longest	living	non-colonial	metazoan	species	with	an	authenticated	lifespan.	It	is	unknown	how	long	it	could	have	lived	if	it	had	not	been	collected	alive	by	an	expedition	in	2006.	In	1868	one	specimen,	collected	alive	near	Iceland,	was	374	years	old.	The	study	of	its	growth	rate	and	the	oxygen	isotope	data	showed	that	it	had	a	highly	variable	growth	at	the	peak	of	the	Little	Ice	Age	around	1550-1620	and	mild	climate	near	its	end	around	1765-1780	and	had	recorded	the	volcanic	eruption	of	Mount	Tambora	in	1815.	One	study	found	that	in	animals	aged	4-192	years,	antioxidant	enzymes	declined	rapidly	in	the	first	25	years,	which	includes	the	growth	and	sexual	maturity	stages,	but	afterwards	remained	stable	for	over	150	years.	Though	more	detailed	studies	are	warranted,	it	appears	this	species	is	a	case	of	negligible	senescence.	In	contrast	to	the	exceptionally	long-lived	populations	in	relatively	deep,	cold	parts	of	its	range,	more	southern	populations	that	experience	greater	seasonal	variations	in	salinity	and	temperature	are	typically	far	shorter-lived.

211	Parker's	passion	for	climbing	began	in	1996	when	he	took	an	ice	climbing	course	in	New	Zealand.	In	2003	he	climbed	Cho	Oyu's	northwest	face	from	Tibet	after	an	unsuccessful	attempt	on	Kangchenjunga.	He	summited	Broad	Peak	for	the	first	time	in	Pakistan	in	2004	(he	made	a	second	unsuccessful	attempt	in	2006).	In	2005,	he	made	attempts	to	climb	Mount	Everest	and	K2,	but	failed	in	both.	On	K2,	he	chose	to	give	up	his	chance	of	reaching	the	summit	in	order	to	bring	an	endangered	Irish	climber	to	safety	and	escort	him	back	to	base	camp;	on	Everest,	he	was	forced	to	retreat	because	of	poor	weather.	In	2007,	Parker	joined	the	Australian	Army	Alpine	Association—for	whom	he	led	numerous	expeditions—on	their	attempt	to	climb	Gasherbrum	I	in	Pakistan.	After	leaving	the	rest	of	the	team	who	decided	to	turn	around,	he	continued	climbing	alone	and	reached	the	summit	on	29	July,	becoming	the	second	Australian	to	have	climbed	the	mountain.	He	also	made	a	solo	attempt	on	Dhaulagiri	I	in	2007,	but	abandoned	the	expedition	after	falling	into	a	crevasse.	In	2008,	Parker	made	his	second	attempt	on	Manaslu	in	Nepal,	reaching	the	summit	on	14	May.

Zweifel,	a	specialist	in	New	Guinean	herpetology	and	microhylid	frogs;	he	is	also	said	to	share	characteristically	terse	vocalizations	with	this	frog.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91	Beinn	an	Lochain	is	a	mountain	in	the	Arrochar	Alps,	southern	Scotland,	on	the	western	edge	of	Loch	Lomond	and	the	Trossachs	National	Park.	Although	included	in	Sir	Hugh	Munro's	original	list	of	Scottish	mountains	over	3000	feet,	subsequent	surveys	showed	it	to	be	significantly	shorter	than	the	914.4	m	cut-off	limit	required	to	count	as	a	Munro.	Nonetheless,	it	remains	a	popular	mountain,	and	is	often	quoted	as	an	example	of	an	interesting	mountain	below	3000	feet	to	show	that	there	is	more	to	mountaineering	in	Scotland	than	just	Munro-bagging.	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
191	The	original	volcano	on	the	site	of	Mount	Giluwe	formed	roughly	650,000-800,000	years	ago,	probably	as	a	stratovolcano	of	similar	height	to	the	current	peak.	Extensive	Pleistocene	glaciation	eroded	away	much	of	the	peak,	leaving	a	series	of	volcanic	plugs	which	form	the	present-day	summits.	A	renewed	episode	of	extensive	volcanic	eruptions	formed	the	shield-like	bulk	of	the	current	mountain	between	220,000-300,000	years	ago,	and	there	is	evidence	that	some	of	the	lava	erupted	subglacially.	During	the	last	glaciations	of	the	Ice	Age,	the	upper	slopes	were	covered	by	a	massive	ice	cap	over	150	m	(500	ft)	thick,	from	which	only	the	main	and	east	peaks	protruded	as	nunataks	above	the	ice	surface.	At	its	maximum	extent,	the	ice	cap	was	over	15	km	(9	mi)	across	and	covered	an	area	greater	than	100	km²	(40	mi²).	Outlet	glaciers	extended	down	as	low	as	3,200-3,500	m	(10,500-11,500	ft),	leaving	a	variety	of	deposits	including	glacial	till	and	moraines.	Although	the	glaciers	are	now	long	gone,	numerous	cirques	and	U-shaped	valleys	remain	visible.

101	While	this	type	of	national	park	had	been	proposed	previously,	the	United	States	established	the	first	public	park	or	pleasuring-ground	for	the	benefit	and	enjoyment	of	the	people,	Yellowstone	National	Park,	in	1872.	Although	Yellowstone	was	not	officially	termed	a	national	park	in	its	establishing	law,	it	was	always	termed	such	in	practice	and	is	widely	held	to	be	the	first	and	oldest	national	park	in	the	world.	However,	the	Tobago	Main	Ridge	Forest	Reserve	(established	in	1776),	and	the	area	surrounding	Bogd	Khan	Uul	Mountain	(1778)	are	seen	as	the	oldest	legally	protected	areas,	predating	Yellowstone	by	nearly	a	century.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

267	Cadell	appears	to	have	been	driven	out	of	his	father	Cadeyrn's	kingdom	by	Irish	pirates	during	the	chaos	of	the	Saxon	insurrection	in	Southern	Britain.	He	hid	himself	amongst	the	peasants	of	Powys	and	became	a	servant	of	the	Irish	chieftain,	Benlli,	hoping,	one	day,	to	find	an	opportunity	to	retrieve	his	inheritance.	His	chance	arose	when	St.	Germanus	of	Auxerre	visited	Britain,	probably	for	the	second	time	in	AD	447,	to	combat	Pelagian	views	(opposition	to	the	new	dogma	of	Original	Sin).	Travelling	into	the	Midlands,	St.	Germanus	heard	of	the	pagan	Irish	stronghold	and,	with	his	many	followers,	laid	siege	to	the	Powysian	capital.	Cadell	showed	them	what	modest	hospitality	he	could	in	his	rural	hovel	outside	the	city	walls.	Germanus	eventually	had	a	dreadful	premonition	and	advised	Cadell	to	remove	all	his	friends	from	within	the	city	walls.	That	night,	the	Royal	palace	was	struck	by	lightning.	The	resulting	fire	spread	quickly	and	all	within	the	city	were	burnt	alive.	The	young	Cadell	was	thus	restored	to	his	throne.	It	is	unclear	where	the	kingdom's	capital	was	at	the	time;	tradition	suggests	the	Clwydian	hillfort	Foel	Fenlli,	the	'Hill	of	Benlli',	while	archaeological	evidence	points	to	Caer	Guricon	(Wroxeter,	Shropshire).	The	latter	was	occupied	well	into	the	6th	century,	and	an	ancient	memorial	stone	bearing	the	Irish	name	Cunorix	has	been	discovered	here.	Cadell	married	Gwelfyl,	one	of	the	many	daughters	of	King	Brychan	Brycheiniog.	They	had	a	number	of	children	including	his	heir,	Cyngen	Glodrydd,	and	Tegid,	the	father	of	Gwynllyw;	and	possibly	Gwynfyr	Frych,	Ystradwel	and	Ddewer.

189	There	were	no	continents	during	the	early	stages	of	the	Archean	Eon,	but	island	arcs	did	form.	It	was	the	coalescence	of	several	of	these	island	arcs	that	led	to	the	formation	of	the	Kaapvaal	Craton,	one	of	the	first	microcontinents	to	form	on	earth	about	3900	million	years	ago.	Its	size	and	position	relative	to	Southern	Africa	today	are	indicated	in	the	diagram	on	the	left.	About	3000	million	years	ago	local	cooling	of	the	underlying	asthenosphere	caused	subsidence	of	the	south	eastern	portion	of	this	microcontinent	below	sea	level.	The	floor	of	this	newly	formed	Witwatersrand	sea	consisted	of	smoothly	eroded	granites.	Sandy	sediments	brought	in	by	rivers	from	the	north	started	being	deposited	on	the	granite	about	2970	million	years	ago.	This	sandy	layer	eventually	became	compressed	to	form	the	Orange	Grove	Quartzite,	the	lowermost	layer	of	the	Witwatersrand	Supergroup.	This	quartzite	layer	can	be	seen	lying	on	its	granite	base	in	Johannesburg,	where	it	forms	a	56	km	long	east-west	ridge	over	which	several	rivers	running	to	the	north	form	waterfalls,	giving	rise	to	the	name	Witwatersrand,	which	in	Afrikaans	means	Ridge	of	White	Waters.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

208	As	it	runs	along	the	Rhine	the	Lower	Germanic	Limes	passes	four	landscapes	with	different	topography	and	natural	character.	The	southernmost	and	smallest	portion,	between	the	Vinxtbach	and	the	area	around	Bonn	still	belongs	to	the	Rhenish	Massif,	through	which	the	river	passes	in	a	relatively	narrow	valley	between	the	heights	of	the	Westerwald	and	the	Eifel	Mountains.	From	roughly	the	area	of	Bonn,	the	Rhine	valley	opens	into	the	Cologne	Bay,	which	is	bounded	by	the	Bergisches	Land,	which	hugs	the	river	on	the	right-hand	side,	and	the	Eifel	and	High	Fens	to	the	southeast	and	east.	The	Cologne	Bay	has	fertile	loess	soils	and	is	characterized	by	a	very	mild	climate.	It	is	therefore	little	wonder	that	most	of	the	rural	vici	and	villae	rusticae	(farm	estates)	in	Lower	Germania	were	established	in	this	area	in	Roman	times.	In	the	vicinity	of	the	military	camp	of	Novaesium,	the	Cologne	Bay	expands	further	into	the	Lower	Rhine	Plain,	a	river	terrace	landscape.	Only	a	little	west	of	today's	German-Dutch	border,	roughly	in	the	area	of	the	legion	camp	of	Noviomagus,	the	Lower	Rhine	Plain	transitions	into	the	watery	marshland	formed	by	the	Rhine	and	Meuse	and	which	finally	ends	at	the	North	Sea	in	the	Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt	delta.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

146	The	purpose	of	this	book,	then,	is	altogether	different	from	that	of	the	volumes	of	The	History	of	Middle-earth	from	which	it	is	derived.	It	is	emphatically	not	intended	as	an	adjunct	to	those	books.	It	is	an	attempt	to	extract	one	narrative	element	from	a	vast	work	of	extraordinary	richness	and	complexity;	but	that	narrative,	the	story	of	Beren	and	Lúthien,	was	itself	continually	evolving,	and	developing	new	associations	as	it	became	more	embedded	in	the	wider	history.	The	decision	of	what	to	include	and	what	to	exclude	of	that	ancient	world	'at	large'	could	only	be	a	matter	of	personal	and	often	questionable	judgement:	in	such	an	attempt	there	can	be	no	attainable	'correct	way'.	In	general,	however,	I	have	erred	on	the	side	of	clarity,	and	resisted	the	urge	to	explain,	for	fear	of	undermining	the	primary	purpose	and	method	of	the	book.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

245	The	area	now	enclosed	as	Bradgate	Park	was	one	of	a	number	of	parks	surrounding	Charnwood	Forest.	Since	medieval	times	it	has	been	part	of	the	Manor	of	Groby.	In	the	reign	of	Edward	the	Confessor,	the	area	was	owned	by	Ulf.	The	manor,	along	with	some	100	others	in	and	around	Leicestershire,	was	awarded	to	Hugh	de	Grandmesnil	in	the	eleventh	century	as	reward	for	his	assistance	in	battle	to	William	I.	The	name	Bradgate	is	thought	to	derive	from	Norse	or	Anglo-Saxon,	meaning	broad	road	or	broad	gate	respectively.	The	first	mention	of	Bradgate	Park	is	from	1241,	by	which	time	it	was	laid	out	as	a	hunting	park,	although	rather	smaller	than	the	current	boundary.	It	was	subsequently	acquired	by	the	Beaumont	family,	passing	to	the	de	Quincy	family	and	on	to	William	de	Ferrers	of	Groby.	It	remained	in	the	de	Ferrers	family	until	1445,	when	it	passed	to	the	Grey	family	after	William's	only	surviving	daughter	married	Edward	Grey.	The	inquisition	into	the	estates	of	de	Ferrers,	made	after	his	death,	mentions	the	park,	with	herbage,	pannage	and	underwood,	worth	40	shillings	yearly.	The	Grey	family	retained	it	for	the	next	500	years,	and	in	the	19th	century	was	opened	to	the	public	several	days	a	week.	In	1928	it	was	bought	by	Charles	Bennion	and	given,	as	a	plaque	in	the	park	describes,	'to	be	preserved	in	its	natural	state	for	the	quiet	enjoyment	of	the	people	of	Leicestershire'.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

127	From	a	biological	perspective,	the	Krakatau	problem	refers	to	the	question	of	whether	the	islands	were	completely	sterilized	by	the	1883	eruption	or	whether	some	indigenous	life	survived.	When	the	first	researchers	reached	the	islands	in	May	1884,	the	only	living	thing	they	found	was	a	spider	in	a	crevice	on	the	south	side	of	Rakata.	Life	quickly	recolonized	the	islands,	however;	Verbeek's	visit	in	October	1884	found	grass	shoots	already	growing.	The	eastern	side	of	the	island	has	been	extensively	vegetated	by	trees	and	shrubs,	presumably	brought	there	as	seeds	washed	up	by	ocean	currents	or	carried	in	birds'	droppings	(or	brought	by	natives	and	scientific	investigators).

197	Douglas	Adams	developed	his	deep-seated	interest	in	wildlife	conservation	during	a	1985	visit	to	Madagascar,	which	eventually	resulted	in	a	book	(Last	Chance	to	See)	about	the	plight	of	species	facing	extinction,	co-authored	by	zoologist	Mark	Carwardine.	In	one	of	the	chapters	he	and	Mark	visited	Garamba	National	Park	in	the	Democratic	Republic	of	Congo,	home	to	the	last	surviving	northern	white	rhinos.	It	was	when	Douglas	gave	a	talk	at	the	Royal	Geographical	Society	about	his	attempts	to	catch	sight	of	one	of	these	elusive	rhinos	by	standing	on	top	of	a	termite	mound	that	Dave	Stirling,	founding	director	of	SRI,	first	approached	him	and	asked	him	to	become	a	patron.	Douglas	went	on	to	accompany	Dave	and	the	rest	of	the	SRI	team	on	their	inaugural	Rhino	Climb	Kili	expedition;	a	now	yearly	event	that	involves	scaling	Mount	Kilimanjaro	-	the	highest	point	on	the	African	continent	-	with	one	member	of	the	team	dressed	as	a	rhino	at	all	times.	Douglas	took	turns	to	wear	the	costume	along	with	everybody	else,	and	his	enthusiasm	for	the	project	helped	to	motivate	SRI	to	raise	£100,000	to	go	towards	community	projects	in	the	areas	surrounding	Kilimanjaro.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

175	The	first	Indonesians	to	adopt	Islam	are	thought	to	have	done	so	as	early	as	the	eleventh	century,	although	Muslims	had	visited	Indonesia	early	in	the	Muslim	era.	The	spread	of	Islam	was	driven	by	increasing	trade	links	outside	of	the	archipelago;	in	general,	traders	and	the	royalty	of	major	kingdoms	were	the	first	to	adopt	the	new	religion.	Dominant	kingdoms	included	Majapahit	Kingdom	in	Central	Java,	and	the	sultanates	of	Ternate	and	Tidore	in	the	Maluku	Islands	to	the	east.	By	the	end	of	the	thirteenth	century,	Islam	had	been	established	in	North	Sumatra;	by	the	fourteenth	in	northeast	Malaya,	Brunei,	the	southern	Philippines	and	among	some	courtiers	of	East	Java;	and	the	fifteenth	in	Malacca	and	other	areas	of	the	Malay	Peninsula.

128	On	13	October	1989	Carsolio	headed	a	Mexican	expedition	to	make	summit	on	Mount	Everest	by	the	southeast	route	without	the	aid	of	bottled	oxygen.	This	was	a	pending	account	with	the	mountain,	months	before	with	Elsa	Ávila;	they	had	to	abort	the	mission	because	his	partner	got	severe	pulmonary	edema	only	92	meters	(302	ft),	from	the	summit.	They	were	forced	to	retreat.	Elsa	would	summit	Everest	10	years	later.

131	Bingham	Canyon	was	a	city	formerly	located	in	southwestern	Salt	Lake	County,	Utah,	United	States,	in	a	narrow	canyon	on	the	eastern	face	of	the	Oquirrh	Mountains.	The	Bingham	Canyon	area	boomed	during	the	first	years	of	the	twentieth	century,	as	rich	copper	deposits	in	the	canyon	began	to	be	developed,	and	at	its	peak	the	city	had	approximately	15,000	residents.	The	success	of	the	local	mines	eventually	proved	to	be	the	town's	undoing,	however:	by	the	mid-twentieth	century	the	huge	open-pit	Bingham	Canyon	Mine	began	encroaching	on	the	land	of	the	community,	causing	residents	to	relocate.	By	the	1970s,	almost	the	entirety	of	the	town	had	been	devoured	by	the	mine,	and	the	few	remaining	residents	voted	to	disincorporate	and	abandon	the	community.

218	In	1809,	still	under	the	Napoleonic	Act	of	Mediation,	the	first	topographical	surveys	of	Switzerland	took	place	on	a	confederate,	military	level.	They	took	place	in	the	north-eastern	area	and	were	led	by	Hans	Conrad	Finsler.	Measurements	in	the	alpine	region	started	in	the	period	of	Restauration,	in	1825,	with	triangulations	by	Antoine-Joseph	Buchwalder.	This	work	would	be	finished	in	1837	by	Johannes	Eschmann.	Directly	hereafter,	at	New	Year	1838,	the	Topographical	Bureau	(Eidgenössisches	Topographisches	Bureau)	is	founded	in	Carouge,	Geneve	by	Guillaume	Henri	Dufour.	This	bureau	publishes	its	first	map	the	same	year,	the	Carte	topographique	du	Canton	de	Genève.	Topographic	surveys	also	start	in	the	alpine	regions	of	Switzerland.	This	has	its	first	results	in	1845,	a	year	later	than	planned,	when	a	map	scaled	1:100.000	is	published.	This	is	the	start	of	the	so-called	Dufour	Map.	The	topographic	surveys	finish	in	1862.	To	honour	Dufour,	the	Swiss	government	decides	to	rename	the	highest	peak	on	the	Dufour	Map	from	Höchste	Spitze	to	Dufourspitze:	it	still	carries	that	name	today.	In	1863,	the	SAC	published	a	1:50.000	map	of	the	region	Tödi,	based	on	unpublished	survey	material.

Famous	peaks	such	as	the	triumvirate	of	the	Trettachspitze,	Mädelegabel	and	Hochfrottspitze	or	Hohes	Licht	(the	highest	peak	of	the	subgroup	at	NN)	are	located	in	this	sub-range.	However,	there	are	also	isolated	areas	such	as	the	Himmelschrofen	ridge	and	Peischel	Group	which	lies	to	the	south	alongside	the	Lech	Valley.	The	main	peaks	are	formed	from	main	dolomite.	This	so-called	Lechtal	Nappe	(Lechtaldecke)	has	been	pushed	onto	the	Allgäu	Beds	made	of	lias.	There	are	examples	of	this	overthrust	plate	in	many	places,	for	example,	in	the	vicinity	of	the	Kempten	Hut	(Trettach	Gully)	or	the	Rappensee	Hut	(Linkerskopf).	In	some	cases	even	a	double	overthrust	of	the	rocks	may	be	observed.	Thus,	the	northern	part	of	Himmelschrofen	ridge	is	made	of	main	dolomite.	The	southern	part	consists	of	lias	rock	of	the	Allgäu	Beds	that	have	been	pushed	over	the	main	dolomite.	In	turn	the	main	dolomite	has	been	thrust	over	the	Allgäu	Beds	again.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
206	Following	the	Louisiana	Purchase	by	the	United	States	in	1803,	it	was	generally	agreed	that	the	boundary	between	the	new	territory	and	British	North	America	was	along	the	watershed	between	the	Missouri	River	and	Mississippi	River	basins	on	one	side	and	the	Hudson	Bay	basin	on	the	other.	However,	it	is	often	difficult	to	precisely	determine	the	location	of	a	watershed	in	a	region	of	level	plains,	such	as	in	central	North	America.	The	British	and	American	committees	that	met	after	the	War	of	1812	to	resolve	boundary	disputes	recognized	there	would	be	much	animosity	in	surveying	the	watershed	boundary,	and	agreed	on	a	simpler	border	solution	in	the	Treaty	of	1818:	the	49th	parallel.	Both	sides	gained	and	lost	some	territory	by	this	convention,	but	the	United	States	gained	more	than	it	lost,	in	particular	securing	title	to	the	Red	River	Basin.	This	treaty	established	the	boundary	only	between	the	line	of	longitude	of	the	northwesternmost	point	of	Lake	of	the	Woods,	on	the	east,	and	the	Rocky	Mountains,	on	the	west.	West	of	the	Rockies,	the	treaty	established	joint	occupation	of	the	Oregon	Country	by	both	parties;	east	of	Lake	of	the	Woods,	the	boundary	established	in	the	Treaty	of	Paris	would	be	retained.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

227	After	the	Roman	conquest	of	the	Nabataean	Empire	and	the	Roman	naval	presence	at	Aden	to	curb	piracy,	Arab	and	Somali	merchants	barred	Indian	merchants	from	trading	in	the	free	port	cities	of	the	Arabian	peninsula	because	of	the	nearby	Roman	presence.	However,	they	continued	to	trade	in	the	port	cities	of	the	Somali	peninsula,	which	was	free	from	any	Roman	threat	or	spies.	The	reason	for	barring	Indian	ships	from	entering	the	wealthy	Arabian	port	cities	was	to	protect	and	hide	the	exploitative	trade	practices	of	the	Somali	and	Arab	merchants	in	the	extremely	lucrative	ancient	Red	Sea-Mediterranean	Sea	commerce.	The	Indian	merchants	for	centuries	brought	large	quantities	of	cinnamon	from	Ceylon	and	the	Far	East	to	Somalia	and	Arabia.	This	is	said	to	have	been	the	best	kept	secret	of	the	Arab	and	Somali	merchants	in	their	trade	with	the	Roman	and	Greek	world.	The	Romans	and	Greeks	believed	the	source	of	cinnamon	to	have	been	the	Somali	peninsula	but	in	reality,	the	highly	valued	product	was	brought	to	Somalia	by	way	of	Indian	ships.	Through	Somali	and	Arab	traders,	Indian/Chinese	cinnamon	was	also	exported	for	far	higher	prices	to	North	Africa,	the	Near	East	and	Europe,	which	made	the	cinnamon	trade	a	very	profitable	revenue	generator,	especially	for	the	Somali	merchants	through	whose	hands	large	quantities	were	shipped	across	ancient	sea	and	land	routes.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
161	The	temple	follows	Pancharatra	Agama	and	Vadakalai	tradition.	The	temple	priests	perform	the	puja	(rituals)	during	festivals	and	on	a	daily	basis.	Like	other	Vishnu	temples	of	Tamil	Nadu,	the	priests	belong	to	the	Brahmin	Vaishnavite	sect,	which	is	dedicated	to	Vishnu.	The	temple	rituals	are	performed	six	times	a	day;	Tiruvanandal	at	8:00	a.m.,	Kala	santhi	at	9:00	a.m.,	Uchikalam	at	12:30	p.m.,	Ntiyanusandhanam	at	6:00	p.m.,	Irandamkalam	at	7:30	p.m.	and	Ardha	Jamam	at	9:00	p.m.	Each	ritual	comprises	three	steps:	alangaram	(decoration),	neivethanam	(food	offering)	and	deepa	aradanai	(waving	of	lamps)	for	both	Sarangapani	and	Thayar.	The	food	offering	during	the	six	times	are	curd	rice,	Ven	pongal,	spiced	rice,	dosa,	Ven	pongal	and	sugar	pongal	respectively.	The	worship	is	held	amidst	music	with	nagaswaram	(pipe	instrument)	and	tavil	(percussion	instrument),	religious	instructions	in	the	Vedas	(sacred	text)	read	by	priests	and	prostration	by	worshippers	in	front	of	the	temple	mast.

177	Shahin	is	first	mentioned	in	602,	after	the	outbreak	of	the	Byzantine-Sasanian	War	of	602-628,	where	he	commanded	the	forces	invading	Byzantine	territory	in	the	Transcaucasia,	winning	a	battle	against	Domentziolus	near	Theodosiopolis	in	607/8.	Following	the	expulsion	of	Roman	forces	from	that	region,	in	611	Shahin	led	an	advance	into	Anatolia,	capturing	Caesarea.	There,	Phocas'	son-in-law	Priscus,	started	a	year-long	siege	to	trap	them	inside	the	city.	However,	Shahin's	troops	escaped	Priscus'	blockade	and	burned	Caesarea,	much	to	Heraclius'	displeasure.	In	613	the	Roman	offensive	pressed	on	into	Syria,	but	the	combined	Persian	armies	under	Shahin	and	Shahrbaraz	crushingly	defeated	Heraclius	near	Antioch.	After	this	victory	the	Persians	looted	the	city,	slew	the	Patriarch	of	Antioch	and	deported	many	citizens.	Roman	forces	lost	again	while	attempting	to	defend	the	area	just	to	the	north	of	Antioch	at	the	Cilician	Gates,	despite	some	initial	success.	The	Persians	then	captured	Tarsus	and	the	Cilician	plain.

Following	first	financial	difficulties	and	then	vandalism,	the	hotel	closed	permanently	in	the	mid-1970s.	The	uniqueness	and	outstanding	natural	beauty	of	the	location	attracted	the	stars	of	the	era,	and	it	served	as	the	setting	for	the	filming	of	some	scenes	from	the	movie	La	Bride	sur	le	cou	(The	Bride	of	the	neck),	with	Brigitte	Bardot;	the	lead	actress	stayed	at	the	hotel	longer	than	expected,	as	access	was	cut	off	due	to	a	snowstorm.

Other	notable	introductions	include	Sitka	Spruce,	Sugar	Pine,	Western	White	Pine,	Ponderosa	Pine,	Lodgepole	Pine,	Monterey	Pine,	Grand	Fir,	Noble	Fir	and	several	other	conifers	that	transformed	the	British	landscape	and	timber	industry,	as	well	as	numerous	garden	shrubs	and	herbs	such	as	the	Flowering	currant,	Salal,	Lupin,	Penstemon	and	California	poppy.	His	success	was	well	beyond	expectations;	in	one	of	his	letters	to	Hooker,	he	wrote	you	will	begin	to	think	I	manufacture	pines	at	my	pleasure.

240	The	festival	originated	from	the	Cold	Food	or	Hanshi	Festival	which	remembered	Jie	Zitui,	a	nobleman	of	the	state	of	Jin	(modern	Shanxi)	during	the	Spring	and	Autumn	Period.	Amid	the	Li	Ji	Unrest,	he	followed	his	master	Prince	Chong'er	in	655BC	to	exile	among	the	Di	tribes	and	around	China.	Supposedly,	he	once	even	cut	flesh	from	his	own	thigh	to	provide	his	lord	with	soup.	In	636BC,	Duke	Mu	of	Qin	invaded	Jin	and	enthroned	Chong'er	as	its	duke,	where	he	was	generous	in	rewarding	those	who	had	helped	him	in	his	time	of	need.	Owing	either	to	his	own	high-mindedness	or	to	the	duke's	neglect,	however,	Jie	was	long	passed	over.	He	finally	retired	to	the	forest	around	Mount	Mian	with	his	elderly	mother.	The	duke	went	to	the	forest	in	but	could	not	find	them.	He	then	ordered	his	men	to	set	fire	to	the	forest	in	order	to	force	Jie	out.	When	Jie	and	his	mother	were	killed	instead,	the	duke	was	overcome	with	remorse	and	erected	a	temple	in	his	honor.	The	people	of	Shanxi	subsequently	revered	Jie	as	an	immortal	and	avoided	lighting	fires	for	as	long	as	a	month	in	the	depths	of	winter,	a	practice	so	injurious	to	children	and	the	elderly	that	the	area's	rulers	unsuccessfully	attempted	to	ban	it	for	centuries.

217	What	is	now	Route	208	was	initially	planned	as	Route	S4B	in	1929,	a	spur	of	Route	4	that	was	to	run	from	Fair	Lawn	northwest	to	the	New	York	border	in	Greenwood	Lake,	where	it	would	eventually	connect	to	New	York	State	Route	208	(NY	208).	This	route	replaced	what	was	planned	as	a	part	of	Route	3	in	1927	between	Paterson	and	Greenwood	Lake.	By	the	time	the	route	was	renumbered	to	Route	208	in	1953	to	match	NY	208,	only	a	portion	of	the	route	in	Fair	Lawn	from	Route	4	to	Maple	Avenue	had	been	built.	Route	208	was	completed	west	to	U.S.	Route	202	(US	202)	in	Oakland	by	1960	as	a	two-lane	undivided	road;	it	would	be	built	into	its	present	configuration	in	later	years.	A	Route	208	freeway	was	planned	across	the	Ramapo	Mountains	from	Oakland	to	connect	to	a	proposed	NY	208	freeway	at	Greenwood	Lake;	however,	it	was	never	built.	After	I-287	was	extended	from	Montville	to	the	New	York	border	in	1993,	it	took	over	the	alignment	of	Route	208	between	US	202	and	the	route's	current	northern	terminus.

314	The	land	structure	of	the	Yinzhou	area	belongs	to	the	Luxi	fault	block	uplift	(level	III)	and	the	Zhangzhou	fault	(Grade	IV)	unit.	The	eastern	part	of	the	boundary	is	the	Yishan	fault,	the	west	is	the	Sunshidian	fault,	and	the	north	is	the	Wensi	fault.	It	is	the	Fushan	fault.	Yanzhou	is	part	of	it.	The	basement	is	the	metamorphic	rock	series	of	the	Mount	Tai	Group.	The	Paleozoic,	Mesozoic	and	Cenozoic	strata	are	developed	above	the	basement.	Among	them,	rich	industrial	coal	seams	are	formed	in	the	Late	Paleozoic	strata,	which	is	an	important	base	for	Yanzhou	becoming	national	coal	resources.	The	tectonic	movement	in	the	territory	has	shaped	various	structural	topography,	which	are	roughly	two	types	of	fault	structure	and	fold	structure.	The	strata	of	all	walks	of	life	are	developed	from	the	old	to	the	new	for	the	Early	Paleozoic	strata,	the	Paleozoic	strata,	the	Mesozoic	strata,	and	the	Neogene	stratigraphic	strata.	In	the	early	Paleozoic,	the	horizon	was	in	a	state	of	slow	decline,	with	large-scale	transgression,	and	the	deposition	of	thick	shallow	sand	shale	and	carbonate	rock	formations.	The	Ordovician	rocks	in	the	Paleozoic	are	mainly	light	gray	and	gray	thick	layered	limestone,	crystalline	limestone	and	leopard	skin	limestone;	the	Carboniferous	rocks	are	mainly	gray-white	siltstone,	clay	rock,	shale	and	thin	layer	limestone.	Several	layers	of	coal;	the	two	rocks	are	mainly	grayish	white,	dark	gray	sandstone	and	variegated	mudstone	and	brown	shale,	rich	in	plant	fossils.	The	Mesozoic	Jurassic	rocks	are	mainly	brown	sandstone,	conglomerate,	variegated	mudstone	and	glutenite.	The	Cenozoic	is	made	up	of	Tertiary	and	Quaternary	strata.	The	Tertiary	is	sandstone,	sticky	sandstone,	and	mudstone;	the	Quaternary	strata	are	loose	rock	formations	composed	of	Wenyu	alluvial	deposits.

The	wild,	grief-stricken	Shiva	wandered	the	universe	with	her	half-burnt	corpse.

As	a	result,	after	King	Fahd's	approval,	President	Bush	deployed	a	significant	amount	of	American	military	forces	(up	to	543,000	ground	troops	by	the	end	of	the	operation)	to	protect	Saudi	Arabia	from	a	possible	Iraqi	invasion;	this	operation	was	called	Desert	Shield.	Furthermore,	the	U.S.	sent	additional	troops	in	operation	Desert	Storm	with	nearly	100,000	Saudi	troops	sent	by	Fahad	to	form	a	US-Saudi	army	alliance,	along	with	troops	from	other	allied	countries,	to	attack	Iraqi	troops	in	Kuwait	and	to	stop	further	invasion.

128	Andy	Schleck	retired	from	the	tour,	before	the	departure	from	Le	Touquet.	A	few	kilometres	into	the	stage,	Chris	Froome	fell	in	an	accident	which	also	involved	Bauke	Mollema	and	Ion	Izagirre.	Froome	was	able	to	rejoin	the	peloton.	By	the	time	the	race	had	reached	the	top	of	Mont	Noir,	Thomas	Voeckler	was	in	front	of	the	peloton	along	with	Luis	Ángel	Maté.

180	After	obtaining	a	basic	science	degree	from	Yuvaraja's	College,	Mysore,	Madhusudan	did	his	post-graduation	in	wildlife	biology	from	the	Wildlife	Institute	of	India,	Dehradun.	He	worked	on	resource	use	in	and	around	forests	and	its	impact	on	large	mammal	conservation	for	his	PhD	thesis	under	the	guidance	of	Anindya	Sinha.	He	uncovered	the	links	between	coffee	production	in	Brazil	and	patterns	of	cattle	grazing	and	ownership	in	and	around	the	forests	of	Bandipur.	He	found	that	the	global	fall	in	coffee	prices	resulted	in	an	increased	demand	for	cow	dung	used	as	manure	in	coffee	estates	in	several	areas	in	the	Nilgiris	and	Western	Ghats	resulting	in	a	large-scale	export	of	dung	transforming	it	from	a	locally	produced	and	locally	consumed	manure	for	village	agriculture	to	a	high-value	organic	fertilizer	for	commercial	export	to	coffee	plantations.	Following	the	dung	export,	livestock	numbers	in	the	region	increased,	aggravating	grazing	pressures	on	the	forests.	This	work	challenged	the	prevalent	notion	that	resource	use	for	subsistence	is	distinguishable	from	and	preferable	to	commercial	resource	use	in	the	context	of	protected-area	management	in	India.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

179	Castaic	Lake	is	the	lower	and	larger	of	two	main	storage	reservoirs	for	the	West	Branch	of	the	California	Aqueduct.	Water	drawn	from	the	Sacramento-San	Joaquin	River	Delta	is	transported	down	the	San	Joaquin	Valley	via	the	California	Aqueduct	and	pumped	over	the	Tehachapi	Mountains,	where	it	splits	into	the	East	Branch	-	providing	water	for	Riverside	and	San	Bernardino	and	eastern	Los	Angeles	Counties	-	and	the	West	Branch,	which	supplies	western	Los	Angeles	and	parts	of	Ventura	County.	The	West	Branch	first	enters	Pyramid	Lake,	formed	by	Pyramid	Dam,	before	traveling	through	the	Angeles	Tunnel	to	the	upper	end	of	Castaic	Lake.	Together,	the	two	reservoirs	can	store	,	or	about	a	year's	supply	of	water.	During	normal	operations,	Castaic	Lake	serves	as	a	regulatory	reservoir	for	water	delivered	through	the	California	Aqueduct,	releasing	it	at	times	of	peak	demand.	However,	the	dam	and	lake	was	also	built	to	provide	a	pool	of	emergency	storage	that	can	be	drawn	down	if	water	deliveries	from	northern	California	are	interrupted,	whether	due	to	construction,	equipment	malfunction	or	severe	drought.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

201	Extensive	building	works	took	place	on	the	Temple	Mount	and	outside	of	its	walls	under	Abd	al-Malik's	son	and	successor	al-Walid	I	(r.	705	-	715).	Modern	historians	generally	credit	al-Walid	with	the	construction	of	the	al-Aqsa	Mosque	on	the	Temple	Mount,	though	the	mosque	may	have	been	originally	built	by	his	Umayyad	predecessors;	according	to	the	latter	view,	al-Walid	was	nonetheless	responsible	for	part	of	the	mosque's	construction.	The	Aphrodito	Papyri	indicate	that	laborers	from	Egypt	were	sent	to	Jerusalem	for	terms	ranging	between	six	months	and	one	year	to	work	on	the	al-Aqsa	Mosque,	al-Walid's	caliphal	palace,	and	a	third,	undefined	building	for	the	Caliph.	Amikam	Elad	holds	that	six	Umayyad	buildings	excavated	south	and	west	of	the	Temple	Mount	may	include	the	palace	and	undefined	building	mentioned	in	the	papyri.	Al-Walid's	brother	and	successor	Sulayman	(r.	715	-	717),	who	had	served	as	the	governor	of	Jund	Filastin	under	al-Walid	and	Abd	al-Malik,	was	initially	recognized	as	caliph	in	Jerusalem	by	the	Arab	tribes	and	dignitaries.	He	resided	in	Jerusalem	for	an	unspecified	period	of	time	during	his	caliphate	and	constructed	a	bathhouse	there,	but	he	may	not	have	shared	the	same	adoration	of	Jerusalem	as	his	predecessors.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

221	The	Confederates,	however,	believed	that	opening	a	route	to	California	would	aid	their	cause.	In	summer	1861,	John	R.	Baylor	led	the	Confederates	into	Mesilla	and	declared	the	southern	portion	of	New	Mexico	as	the	Confederate	Territory	of	Arizona.	He	then	marched	into	Tucson	and	declared	Southern	Arizona	the	second	district	of	the	Arizona	Territory.	In	response	to	this	aggression,	President	Abraham	Lincoln	appointed	Henry	Connelly	-	an	Anglo	politician	who	married	into	a	Mexican	American	family	-	as	the	territorial	governor	of	New	Mexico.	Inspiring	confidence	amongst	the	Nuevomexicanos,	the	Union	army	was	soon	filled	by	Mexican	Americans.	The	New	Mexico	units,	known	as	the	New	Mexico	Volunteers,	were	led	by	Capt.	José	Sena,	Capt.	Rafael	Chacón,	and	J.	Francisco	Chaves.	This	massive	Mexican	American	army	was	able	to	destroy	the	Confederate	hold	on	New	Mexico	by	March	28,	1862,	when	Lt.	Col.

170	Unlike	most	Muslim	countries,	Saudi	Arabia	gives	the	ulema	direct	involvement	in	government,	and	fields	a	specifically	religious	police	force,	called	the	Haia.	(Iran	gives	the	ulema	much	more	influence	and	also	has	a	religious	police.)	According	to	Robert	Baer,	this	power	is	only	over	certain	sectors	of	governance.	The	founder	of	Saudi	Arabia,	Ibn	Saud,	established	a	division	of	power	(according	to	Baer)	with	the	Wahhabi	religious	establishment	in	1932.	In	return	for	allowing	it	control	of	the	mosques,	culture,	and	education,	the	ulema	or	religious	establishment	would	never	go	near	core	political	issues,	such	as	royal	succession,	foreign	policy,	and	the	armed	forces.	This	agreement	has	been	more	or	less	respected	since	1932.	Historians	note	that	in	his	alliance	with	the	House	of	Saud,	Muhammad	ibn	Abd	al-Wahhab	called	for	the	state	to	have	an	imam	(religious	leader,	himself)	and	an	emir	(military	leader,	Ibn	Saud).

One	of	the	roles	of	the	Warden	was	Master	of	Staghounds	and	this	role	continued	to	be	exercised	by	the	Master	of	the	Devon	and	Somerset	Staghounds,	a	position	extant	today.	By	1820	the	royal	forest	had	been	divided	up.	A	quarter	of	the	forest,	,	was	sold	to	John	Knight	(1765-1850)	in	1818.

133	After	his	castration,	the	Sky	came	no	more	to	cover	the	Earth	at	night,	but	held	to	its	place,	and	the	original	begetting	came	to	an	end	(Kerényi).	Uranus	was	scarcely	regarded	as	anthropomorphic,	aside	from	the	genitalia	in	the	castration	myth.

192	Maronite	Christians	felt	a	sense	of	alienation	and	exclusion	as	a	result	of	Pan-Arabism	in	Lebanon.	Part	of	its	historic	suffering	is	the	Damour	massacre	by	the	PLO.	Until	recently,	the	Cyprus	Maronites	battled	to	preserve	their	ancestral	language.	The	Maronite	monks	maintain	that	Lebanon	is	synonymous	with	Maronite	history	and	ethos;	that	its	Maronitism	antedates	the	Arab	conquest	of	Lebanon	and	that	Arabism	is	only	a	historical	accident.	The	Maronites	experienced	mass	persecution	under	the	Ottoman	Turks,	who	massacred	and	mistreated	Maronites	for	their	faith,	disallowing	them	from	owning	horses	and	forcing	them	to	wear	only	black	clothing.	The	Ottoman	Empire's	WW1	policies,	in	combination	with	Allied	Forces	Naval	blockade,	resulted	in	the	death	of	hundreds	of	thousands	of	maronites	of	Mount	Lebanon,	with	total	fatalities	estimated	between	100-300	thousand	people	that	died	from	malnutrition,	disease	and	starvation.	The	Lebanese	Druze	also	persecuted	the	Maronites,	and	massacred	in	excess	of	20,000	of	them	in	the	mid-1800s.	However,	agreements	have	been	held	with	the	Druze.

145	Mount	Data	is	formerly	known	for	its	great	biological	diversity	and	is	a	place	that	has	long	been	in	the	attention	of	biologists.	In	1895,	the	Englishman	John	Whitehead	gathered	a	vast	collection	of	mammals	and	birds	from	the	mountain.	This	mammal	collection	was	then	donated	to	the	British	Museum.	A	research	by	zoologist	Oldfield	Thomas	showed	that	many	unknown	species	inhabit	the	area.	Half	a	century	later,	a	large	collection	of	small	mammals	was	collected	by	an	expedition	led	by	the	Filipino	biologist	Dioscoro	S.	Rabor.	Some	of	these	mammals	are	Carpomys	melanurus	(short-footed	Luzon	tree	rat)	and	Carpomys	phaeurus	(white-bellied	Luzon	tree	rat).	In	addition	to	several	rare	species	of	mammals,	there	are	also	some	bird	species	like	the	Collocalia	whiteheadi	(Whitehead's	swiftlet),	which	was	only	known	then	from	a	specimen	that	was	caught	during	the	expedition	of	John	Whitehead	on	the	mountain.	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

175	Henry	Standing	Bear	(Mato	Naji),	an	Oglala	Lakota	chief,	and	well-known	statesman	and	elder	in	the	Native	American	community,	recruited	and	commissioned	Polish-American	sculptor	Korczak	Ziolkowski	to	build	the	Crazy	Horse	Memorial	in	the	Black	Hills	of	South	Dakota.	In	October	1931,	Luther	Standing	Bear,	Henry's	older	brother,	wrote	to	sculptor	Gutzon	Borglum,	who	was	carving	the	heads	of	four	American	presidents	at	Mount	Rushmore.	Luther	suggested	that	it	would	be	most	fitting	to	have	the	face	of	Crazy	Horse	sculpted	there.	Crazy	Horse	is	the	real	patriot	of	the	Sioux	tribe	and	the	only	one	worthy	to	place	by	the	side	of	Washington	and	Lincoln.	Borglum	never	replied.

276	In	Greece,	Aromanians	are	not	recognised	as	an	ethnic	but	as	a	linguistic	minority	and,	like	the	Arvanites,	have	been	indistinguishable	in	many	respects	from	other	Greeks	since	the	19th	century.	Although	Greek	Aromanians	would	differentiate	themselves	from	native	Greek	speakers	(Grets)	when	speaking	in	Aromanian,	most	still	consider	themselves	part	of	the	broader	Greek	nation	(Elini,	Hellenes),	which	also	encompasses	other	linguistic	minorities	such	as	the	Arvanites	or	the	Slavic	speakers	of	Greek	Macedonia.	Greek	Aromanians	have	long	been	associated	with	the	Greek	national	state,	actively	participated	in	the	Greek	Struggle	for	Independence,	and	have	obtained	very	important	positions	in	government,	although	there	was	an	attempt	to	create	an	autonomous	Aromanian	canton	under	the	protection	of	Italy	at	the	end	of	World	War	I,	called	Principality	of	the	Pindus.	Aromanians	have	been	very	influential	in	Greek	politics,	business	and	the	army.	Revolutionaries	Rigas	Feraios	and	Giorgakis	Olympios,	Prime	Minister	Ioannis	Kolettis,	billionaires	and	benefactors	Evangelos	Zappas	and	Konstantinos	Zappas,	businessman	and	philanthropist	George	Averoff,	Field	Marshal	and	later	Prime	Minister	Alexandros	Papagos,	and	conservative	politician	Evangelos	Averoff	were	all	either	Aromanians	or	of	partial	Aromanian	heritage.	It	is	difficult	to	estimate	the	exact	number	of	Aromanians	in	Greece	today.	The	Treaty	of	Lausanne	of	1923	estimated	their	number	between	150,000	and	200,000,	but	the	last	two	censuses	to	differentiate	between	Christian	minority	groups,	in	1940	and	1951,	showed	26,750	and	22,736	Vlachs	respectively.	Estimates	on	the	number	of	Aromanians	in	Greece	range	between	40,000	and	300,000.	Thede	Kahl	estimates	the	total	number	of	people	with	Aromanian	origin	who	still	understand	the	language	as	no	more	than	300,000,	with	the	number	of	fluent	speakers	under	100,000.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

179	A	stratovolcano	(atop	a	shield	volcano	with	a	symmetrical	shape),	Mount	Bachelor	formed	between	18,000	and	8,000	years	ago.	Bachelor	is	composed	of	basalt	and	basaltic	andesite,	and	though	its	upper	volcanic	cone	formed	after	its	base	shield,	the	two	edifices	show	similar	eruptive	composition.	The	mountain	has	withstood	very	little	alteration	as	a	result	of	glacial	erosion	besides	a	small	cirque	(an	amphitheatre-like	valley	formed	by	glacial	erosion)	on	the	northern	side	of	the	volcano.

A	sportsman	seeking	to	win	through	the	courts	or	through	what	Dennis	called	the	'backdoor'	only	demeans	themselves	as	sportsmen	and	taints	any	victory,	as	well	as	the	sport.

131	In	1867,	General	George	Crook	decided	to	build	a	fort	in	the	Warner	Valley	to	prevent	Indian	raiding	parties	from	passing	through	the	area.	To	get	his	wagons	across	the	wetlands,	he	directed	a	bridge	be	built	across	a	narrow,	marshy	channel	between	Crump	Lake	and	Hart	Lake.	Forty	soldiers	of	the	23rd	Infantry	Regiment	under	the	command	of	Captain	James	Henton	were	assigned	the	task.	The	bridge	was	constructed	between	16	May	and	24	July	1867.

167	Among	all	rivers,	there	was	a	question	on	who	was	superior.	All	the	rivers	approached	the	Hindu	god	of	creation,	Brahma.	He	said	that	during	the	Vamana	avatar,	Vishnu	appeared	as	dwarf	and	later	became	Trivikrama	to	the	king	Mahabali.	He	placed	his	third	feet	on	the	demon	king	and	cleansed	Ganga	by	placing	his	foot	on	it.	Based	on	the	narration,	Brahma	quoted	that	Ganga	was	the	holiest	of	all	rivers.	River	Cauvery	wanted	her	status	to	be	equal	to	river	Ganges	and	performed	a	severe	penance.	To	test	her	devotion,	Vishnu	appeared	in	the	form	of	a	child	in	front	of	her.	Realising	the	anonymity,	Cauvery	treated	the	child	with	care	and	motherly	devotion.	Vishnu	was	pleased	with	her	devotion	and	revealed	all	his	ten	avatars	to	her	and	asked	her	to	visit	Sara	Kshetram	and	have	a	holy	dip	in	the	Sara	Pushkarani.

150	In	Garuda	Purana,	there	was	nothing	in	the	universe	except	Brahman.	The	universe	became	an	expanse	of	water,	and	in	that	Vishnu	was	born	in	the	golden	egg.	He	created	Brahma	with	four	faces.	Brahma	then	created	the	devas,	asuras,	pitris	and	manushas.	He	also	created	the	rakshasas,	yakshas,	and	gandharvas.	Other	creatures	came	from	the	various	parts	of	his	body	(e.g.	snakes	from	his	hair,	sheep	from	his	chest,	goats	from	his	mouth,	cows	from	his	stomach,	others	from	his	feet).	His	body	hair	became	herbs.	The	four	varnas	came	from	his	body	parts	and	the	four	Vedas	from	his	mouths.

176	The	7338	m	summit	of	Kabru	is	the	site	of	a	mountaineering	altitude	record,	either	in	1883	or	in	1905.	The	English	barrister	William	Graham,	the	Swiss	hotelier	Emil	Boss	and	the	Swiss	mountain	guide	Ulrich	Kauffmann	reported	to	have	reached	a	point	30-40	feet	below	this	summit,	which	Graham	described	as	little	more	than	a	pillar	of	ice,	at	2pm	on	October	8,	1883.

In	2011,	the	U.S.	Congress	passed	the	Gila	Bend	Indian	Reservation	Lands	Replacement	Clarification	Act	(H.R.	2938),	which	amended	the	1986	Act	to	prohibit	gaming	activities	on	any	of	the	land	which	the	Nation	acquired	as	a	result	of	the	earlier	Act.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
111	Until	modern	times	farming	was	the	main	occupation	and	cattle	from	the	off	lying	islands,	Jura,	Scarba,	etc.,	were	landed	near	Craignish	point	and	driven	along	the	peninsula	to	the	mainland	proper.

142	In	addition,	a	new	breed	of	warrior	monks	was	forming	in	the	countryside.	Where	the	monks	of	Mount	Hiei	had	subscribed	to	the	teachings	of	the	Tendai	sect,	these	new	groups,	calling	themselves	Ikkō-ikki,	followed	the	dictates	of	the	Jōdo	Shinshū	sect	of	beliefs.	They	were	essentially	coalitions	of	religious	fundamentalist	priests,	farmers,	and	families,	who	were	willing	to	literally	fight	for	their	beliefs.	Ikkō-ikki	translates	to	something	like	devoted	league,	but	also	had	the	connotation	of	single-minded	riots.	In	1488,	their	leader	Rennyo,	incited	an	uprising	against	samurai	rule,	and	secured	Kaga	Province	for	the	Ikkō-ikki.	From	there	they	spread,	establishing	themselves	in	Nagashima,	Ishiyama	Hongan-ji,	and	Mikawa	Province.	Their	growing	power	base	was	eventually	to	attract	the	attention	of	warlords	like	Oda	Nobunaga	and	Tokugawa	Ieyasu,	who	recognized	their	opposition	to	samurai	rule,	their	determination,	their	strength,	and	their	numbers.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
160	In	1523	forty-three	villages	in	Shuf	Sulayman	Ibn	Ma'n,	including	Baruk,	were	burned	by	the	forces	of	the	Damascus	governor	Khurram	Pasha	for	tax	arrears	and	Ma'nid	disobedience,	and	the	governor's	forces	sent	back	to	Damascus	four	cartloads	of	Druze	heads	and	religious	texts	in	the	aftermath	of	the	campaign.	According	to	Harris,	such	brutality	entrenched	[Druze]	resistance,	and	in	the	following	year	Druze	fighters	killed	subashis	(provincial	officials)	appointed	by	Khurram	Pasha	to	administer	Mount	Lebanon's	subdistricts,	prompting	another	government	expedition	against	the	Chouf,	which	returned	three	cartloads	of	Druze	heads	and	three	hundred	women	and	children	as	captives.	The	death	of	Jamal	al-Din	Hajji	in	prison	in	1521	and	the	Ottoman	expeditions	led	the	Buhturids	to	accept	Ma'nid	precedence	over	the	Druze	of	southern	Mount	Lebanon.	In	1545	the	leading	emir	of	the	Druze,	Yunis	Ma'n,	was	lured	to	Damascus	and	executed	by	the	authorities	under	unclear	circumstances,	but	suggesting	continued	insubordination	by	the	Druze	under	Ma'nid	leadership.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

252	Pattle's	success	in	the	air	was	overshadowed	by	events	on	the	ground.	The	Allied	forces	were	routed	at	Vevi	and	the	Battle	of	the	Metaxas	Line	had	ended	in	total	defeat	for	the	Greek	Army	on	9	April.	Covering	the	Greek	forces	from	Larissa,	Pattle	claimed	another	Do	17	and	SM.79	along	with	a	Bf	109	damaged	for	his	35th	and	36th	aerial	victories.	Interceptions	would	now	be	more	difficult	for	the	port	of	Salonika	fell.	Observers	at	the	port	had	been	able	to	telephone	his	operations	hut	to	warn	him	of	approaching	enemy	aircraft	over	Mount	Olympus.	Pattle	had	to	send	pairs	of	fighters	to	patrol	the	area,	which	helped	act	as	a	rudimentary	warning	system.	The	effect	was	that	there	was	little	warning	of	impending	attacks.	The	Germans,	now	operating	from	forward	airfields,	slipped	through	unnoticed.	On	13	April,	Pattle	witnessed	15	Bf	109s	strafe	the	airfield	as	three	Hurricanes	took	off.	Two	veteran	pilots	were	killed	in	the	very	brief	battle	in	exchange	for	two	Bf	109s.	Pattle	searched	for	the	Hurricane	pilots	and	found	one	fighter	with	a	parachute	beside	it	but	no	pilot.	Pattle	was	to	be	further	disheartened.	One	of	the	German	pilots	bailed	out	and	Pattle	watched	in	horror	as	the	Greek	soldiers	guarding	the	airfield	shot	him	dead	as	he	floated	down	in	his	parachute.	One	of	the	Bf	109s	crash-landed	perfectly.	He	ordered	that	no-one	should	approach	the	Bf	109	in	case	it	was	rigged	with	explosives.

187	After	the	Cold	War,	U.S.-Saudi	relations	were	improving.	The	U.S.	and	U.S.	companies	were	actively	engaged	and	paid	handsomely	for	preparing	and	administrating	the	rebuilding	of	Saudi	Arabia.	Saudi	Arabia	transferred	$100	billion	to	the	United	States	for	administration,	construction,	weapons,	and	in	the	1970s	and	1980s	higher	education	scholarships	to	the	U.S.	During	that	era	the	U.S.	built	and	administrated	numerous	military	academies,	navy	ports,	and	Air	Force	military	airbases.	Many	of	these	military	facilities	were	influenced	by	the	U.S.,	with	the	needs	of	cold	war	aircraft	and	deployment	strategies	in	mind.

The	U.S.	pursued	a	policy	of	building	up	and	training	the	Saudi	military	as	a	counterweight	to	Shiite	extremism	and	revolution	following	the	revolution	in	Iran.	The	U.S.	provided	top	of	the	line	equipment	and	training,	and	consulted	the	Saudi	government	frequently,	acknowledging	them	as	the	most	important	Islamic	leader	in	that	part	of	the	world,	and	a	key	player	in	the	U.S.	security	strategy.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

164	This	hitotsume-nyūdō	and	the	hitotsume-kozō	has	the	appearance	of	a	nyūdō	(monk),	but	there	is	a	theory	that	it	comes	from	the	yōkai	called	from	Mount	Hiei.	As	its	name	implies,	it	is	a	yōkai	or	yūrei	with	the	appearance	of	a	monk	with	one	eye	and	one	foot,	and	it	is	said	that	when	a	monk	idles	on	his	training	on	Mount	Hiei,	he	would	be	admonished	by	being	stared	at	with	one	eye,	and	monks	that	are	terribly	lazy	would	be	driven	out	of	the	mountain.	This	hōshi	has	been	specified	to	be	what	the	18th	Tendaizasu,	Ryōgen	(or	his	best	pupil,	the	19th	Tendaizasu	Jinzen)	turned	into,	and	it	is	believed	that	Ryōgen,	who	judged	the	monks	on	strict	precepts,	lamented	at	how	the	monks	became	secularized	after	his	death,	became	thus	a	yōkai	and	admonished	the	monks.

269	As	per	Shiv	Mahapuran,	once	Brahma	(the	Hindu	God	of	creation)	and	Vishnu	(the	Hindu	God	of	saving)	had	an	argument	in	terms	of	supremacy	of	creation.	To	test	them,	Shiva	pierced	the	three	worlds	as	a	huge	endless	pillar	of	light,	the	jyotirlinga.	Vishnu	and	Brahma	split	their	ways	to	downwards	and	upwards	respectively	to	find	the	end	of	the	light	in	either	directions.	Brahma	lied	that	he	found	out	the	end,	while	Vishnu	conceded	his	defeat.	Shiva	appeared	as	a	second	pillar	of	light	and	cursed	Brahma	that	he	would	have	no	place	in	ceremonies	while	Vishnu	would	be	worshipped	till	the	end	of	eternity.	The	jyotirlinga	is	the	supreme	partless	reality,	out	of	which	Shiva	partly	appears.	The	jyothirlinga	shrines,	thus	are	places	where	Shiva	appeared	as	a	fiery	column	of	light.	Originally,	there	were	believed	to	be	64	jyothirlingas	of	which	12	are	considered	to	be	very	auspicious	and	holy.	Each	of	the	twelve	jyothirlinga	sites	take	the	name	of	the	presiding	deity	-	each	considered	a	different	manifestation	of	Shiva.	At	all	these	sites,	the	primary	image	is	the	lingam	representing	the	Stambha	pillar,	symbolizing	the	infinite	nature	of	Shiva	(without	beginning	or	end).	The	twelve	jyothirlinga	are	Somnath	in	Gujarat,	Mallikarjuna	at	Srisailam	in	Andhra	Pradesh,	Mahakaleswar	at	Ujjain	in	Madhya	Pradesh,	Omkareshwar	in	Madhya	Pradesh,	Kedarnath	in	Himalayas,	Bhimashankar	in	Maharashtra,	Viswanath	at	Varanasi	in	Uttar	Pradesh,	Triambakeshwar	in	Maharashtra,	Vaidyanath	at	Deoghar	in	Jharkhand,	Nageswar	at	Dwarka	in	Gujarat,	Rameshwar	at	Rameswaram	in	Tamil	Nadu	and	Grishneshwar	at	Aurangabad,	Maharashtra.

294	In	September	1793	the	Sardinian	army	tried	to	recapture	the	County	of	Nice.	The	French	right	flank	held	its	ground,	but	on	the	left	Sérurier	gave	up	the	east	bank	of	the	Vésubie	River	and	fell	back	to	Utelle	on	10	September.	Jacques	François	Dugommier	took	command	of	the	left	wing	three	days	later	and	Sérurier	took	charge	of	the	right	wing	of	the	Army	of	the	Alps	at	Entrevaux.	Sérurier	was	arrested	for	retreating	too	much	and	for	being	of	noble	blood.	He	was	reinstated	after	the	representatives	on	mission	and	the	War	Minister	Jean	Baptiste	Noël	Bouchotte	termed	the	charges	as	unimportant	while	the	citizens	of	Laon	sent	a	petition	vouching	for	his	patriotism.	After	the	fighting	petered	out	in	the	December	snow,	Sérurier's	division	was	transferred	to	form	the	left	flank	of	the	Army	of	Italy.	In	January	1794	he	was	denounced	for	listening	to	aristocratic	songs	and	for	not	caring	about	desertions,	but	Bouchotte	and	the	representatives	brushed	aside	these	charges.	Under	army	commander	Pierre	Jadart	Dumerbion	a	French	offensive	began	on	5	April	and	Oneglia	was	seized.	André	Masséna	commanded	the	20,000-man	main	column	on	the	right	wing	while	François	Macquard	directed	the	center	division	and	Pierre	Dominique	Garnier	led	the	left	division.	Sérurier,	who	commanded	Garnier's	left	brigade,	reoccupied	Isola	and	went	on	to	seize	the	Colle	delle	Finestre	against	weak	resistance.	In	the	Second	Battle	of	Saorgio	on	24	April	1794,	Masséna	defeated	Michelangelo	Alessandro	Colli-Marchi,	the	French	inflicting	2,800	casualties	on	the	Sardinians	while	losing	1,500	killed	and	wounded.	In	the	aftermath,	Macquard	occupied	Saorge	and	the	Col	de	Tende	while	Masséna	held	Ormea	in	the	Tanaro	valley.

144	The	Mong	Circle	dates	to	1782	with	the	first	chieftain,	Mrachai.	During	British	rule,	the	British	authorities	designated	the	Mong	Circle	in	1871,	to	encompass	an	ethnically	mixed	population	in	the	Feni	valley.	In	1881,	the	Chittagong	Hill	Tracts	were	administratively	divided	into	three	circles,	namely	the	Chakma	Circle,	the	Bohmong	Circle,	and	the	Mong	Circles,	each	presided	over	by	a	hereditary	chief	from	the	Chakma	and	Marma	peoples.	The	circles	were	codified	into	law	with	the	Chittagong	Hill	Tract	Regulations,	1900,	eased	revenue	collection	and	administrative	burdens	on	British	authorities	by	delegating	tax	collection,	land	administration	management	and	social	arbitration	responsibilities	to	the	chieftains.	In	1901,	the	Mong	Circle	extended	.	This	administrative	structure	remained	in	place	until	1964,	when	the	introduction	of	local	self-government	abolished	the	special	status	of	these	circles	and	brought	local	administration	under	the	control	of	the	central	government.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

220	Although	the	establishments	are	legally	responsible	for	irrigation	and	wastewater	treatment,	they	are	not	engaged	in	these	activities.	There	is	no	strategic	or	business	planning,	nor	a	focus	on	performance.	There	is	a	limited	focus	on	IT	and	on	asset	management;	customer	service	is	fragmented.	By	law	Lebanese	water	utilities	should	have	4,050	employees,	but	they	actually	had	only	1,342	as	of	2010.	This	is	due	to	a	hiring	freeze	imposed	by	the	government.	The	number	of	employees	has	thus	declined	during	the	first	decade	of	the	21st	century.	The	gaps	at	the	lower	levels	were	partially	filled	with	temporary	laborers.	But	there	are	also	important	gaps	in	managerial	positions.	The	average	number	of	staff	is	less	than	2	per	1000	connections,	much	below	the	regional	average.

116	At	a	time	when	nature	conservation	ideas	were	a	long	way	from	the	present	understanding,	some	enlightened	noblemen	took	the	first	step	in	1934	by	declaring	66	km²	of	Vitosha	a	nature	park,	hence	Vitosha	became	the	first	park	of	this	kind	in	the	Balkans.

175	The	Paripatal	manuscripts	suggest	that	it	was	not	purely	an	abstract	literary	work,	rather	a	guide	for	devotional	songs	to	be	sung.	The	poems	also	mention	temples	and	shrines,	thereby	suggesting	that	the	Tamil	people	had	already	built	temples	for	Vishnu,	Murugan	and	other	deities	in	the	Sangam	era.	The	Paripatal	anthology	is	likely	a	late	Sangam	literature,	states	Zvelebil,	separated	from	the	earliest	Sangam	work	by	at	least	three	centuries.	This	is	evidenced	by	the	linguistic	and	grammatical	innovations,	and	its	mention	of	mural	paintings	in	temples	and	other	cultural	innovations.	Takanobu	Takahashi	concurs	that	this	is	a	late	Sangam	work,	and	adds	that	the	poems	were	likely	composed	over	several	generations	over	100-150	years	(3rd	century	CE).	A.	K.	Ramanujan	suggests	this	Sangam	anthology	may	be	from	about	the	6th	century.	The	poems	allude	to	many	pan-Indian	legends,	such	as	the	samudra	manthan	(churning	of	cosmic	ocean),	Vishnu	devotee	Prahlada's	struggle,	Shiva	and	Murugan	legends.

241	The	3.6-2.3	mya	Polan	group,	with	ten	dispersed	volcanoes	including	Miño	Volcano,	is	the	largest	group	in	the	cluster	and	includes	Tres	Monos,	La	Luna,	Cerro	Polan,	Chaihuiri,	Miño	Volcano	and	the	lavas	of	the	Aucanquilcha	platform.	Cerro	Polan's	(3.5-3	mya)	eastern	side	is	deeply	dissected,	and	the	exposed	materials	are	heavily	altered	in	the	deeper	sections.	Lava	fields	to	Polan's	west	and	southwest	(2.6	mya	on	one	western	field)	are	associated	with	it.	La	Luna	(2.97-2.57)	lies	just	east	of	Polan;	these	two	volcanoes	were	probably	one	volcano	in	the	past.	La	Luna	has	a	lava	dome	surrounded	by	a	glaciated	but	unaltered	lava	table.	Cerro	Tres	Monos	(3.4-2.78	mya)	forms	a	northbound	long	ridge	with	at	least	six	vents.	Hydrothermal	alteration	has	affected	some	lavas	and	pyroclastics	from	Tres	Monos,	and	the	western	side	has	lateral	and	terminal	moraines.	The	Aucanquilcha	platform	(3.6-2.7	mya)	sits	underneath	the	main	Aucanquilcha	volcano,	and	its	lava	mostly	flowed	north.	Its	southern	side	is	a	table	with	one	hill,	Cerro	Campana,	dated	to	3.3	mya.

281	In	641,	Emperor	Taizong	was	preparing	to	carry	out	grand	ceremonies	at	Mount	Tai	in	642	to	sacrifice	to	the	gods	of	heaven	and	earth.	At	the	suggestions	of	Xue	Yi	(薛頤)	and	Chu,	however,	he	cancelled	those	plans.	He	also	bestowed	on	Chu	the	title	of	imperial	advisor,	but	continued	to	have	Chu	serve	as	the	recorder	of	his	acts.	Once,	When	Emperor	Taizong	wanted	to	review	the	imperial	historical	records	that	Chu	was	responsible	for	keeping,	Chu	rebuffed	Emperor	Taizong,	stating	that	it	would	be	irregular	for	an	emperor	to	look	at	how	an	imperial	historian	was	writing	about	him.	Emperor	Taizong	then	made	the	comment,	Do	you	record	the	bad	things	I	do	as	well?	Chu	responded,	It	is	my	responsibility,	and	I	would	not	dare	not	to	record	them.	The	chancellor	Liu	Ji	then	stated,	Even	if	Chu	Suiliang	does	not	record	them,	everyone	will.	Emperor	Taizong	agreed	with	both	of	them.	In	642,	when	Chu	was	troubled	by	the	fact	that	Emperor	Taizong	was	overly	favoring	his	son	Li	Tai,	the	Prince	of	Wei,	over	Li	Tai's	elder	brother	Li	Chengqian,	the	Crown	Prince,	Chu	pointed	out	that	an	emperor	to	overly	favor	sons	other	than	heirs	would	have	the	undesirable	effect	of	causing	people	to	speculate	as	to	who	should	succeed	the	emperor.	Emperor	Taizong	gave	oral	approval	of	his	advice,	but	did	not	follow	it.	In	the	subsequent	months,	Chu	would	repeatedly	remind	Emperor	Taizong	of	this	issue,	but	Emperor	Taizong,	while	repeatedly	informing	his	officials	that	he	had	no	intent	to	displace	Li	Chengqian	with	Li	Tai,	was	unable	to	stop	the	government	from	factionalizing	into	Li	Chengqian's	supporters	and	Li	Tai's	supporters.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

174	Rather	than	a	clearly	defined	geographical	term,	Northern	Epirus	is	largely	a	political	and	diplomatic	term	applied	to	those	areas	partly	populated	by	ethnic	Greeks	that	were	incorporated	into	the	newly	independent	Albanian	state	in	1913.

184	In	the	western	Alps,	the	Ligures	probably	spoke	an	Indo-European	language	with	strong	Celtic	similarities	but	also	Italic,	by	that	time.	For	example,	Strabo	describes	one	tribe	in	Provence	(SE	Gaul)	as	Celtoligures.	The	Lepontii	are	one	of	the	tribes	classified	as	Raetian	by	Strabo.	Their	original	language	was	therefore	probably	Raetian.	But	from	the	available	inscriptions,	the	Lepontic	language	is	believed	to	be	Celtic,	with	some	residual	non	Indo-European	elements	-	a	parallel	to	Celtiberian	in	Spain.	The	Raeti	themselves	appear	to	have	undergone	assimilation,	as	Livy	states	that	their	language	(Raetian)	had	become	much	corrupted.	Celtisation	is	also	implied	by	the	establishment	of	joint	Raetorum	et	Vindelicorum	regiments	alongside	the	Celtic-speaking	Vindelici,	and	by	the	union	of	the	territories	of	both	peoples	to	form	the	Raetia	et	Vindelicia	province.	This	assimilation	was	probably	the	result	of	the	great	migrations	of	Gallic	tribes	across	the	Alps,	which,	according	to	Livy,	started	in	c.	600	BC,	continued	until	c.	400	BC	and	ended	in	the	occupation	and	Celtisation	of	much	of	the	Po	Valley	and	of	the	Alpine	regions	through	which	the	migrants	passed.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

229	53	Then	each	of	them	went	home,	1	while	Jesus	went	to	the	Mount	of	Olives.	2Early	in	the	morning	he	came	again	to	the	temple.	All	the	people	came	to	him	and	he	sat	down	and	began	to	teach	them.	3The	scribes	and	the	Pharisees	brought	a	woman	who	had	been	caught	in	adultery;	and	making	her	stand	before	all	of	them,	4they	said	to	him,	Teacher,	this	woman	was	caught	in	the	very	act	of	committing	adultery.	5Now	in	the	law	Moses	commanded	us	to	stone	such	women.	Now	what	do	you	say?	6They	said	this	to	test	him,	so	that	they	might	have	some	charge	to	bring	against	him.	Jesus	bent	down	and	wrote	with	his	finger	on	the	ground.	7When	they	kept	on	questioning	him,	he	straightened	up	and	said	to	them,	Let	anyone	among	you	who	is	without	sin	be	the	first	to	throw	a	stone	at	her.	8And	once	again	he	bent	down	and	wrote	on	the	ground.	9When	they	heard	it,	they	went	away,	one	by	one,	beginning	with	the	elders;	and	Jesus	was	left	alone	with	the	woman	standing	before	him.	10Jesus	straightened	up	and	said	to	her,	Woman,	where	are	they?	Has	no	one	condemned	you?	11She	said,	No	one,	sir.	And	Jesus	said,	Neither	do	I	condemn	you.

105	By	1843,	it	was	becoming	apparent	that	the	mission	was	in	trouble.	Governor	George	Gipps,	who	had	visited	the	area	in	1842,	had	indicated	to	the	missionaries	that	to	continue	receiving	government	funding,	they	would	need	to	move	their	mission	to	a	new	site,	further	away	from	Brisbane.	This	request	was	likely	because	newly	arrived	free	settlers	in	the	area	were	beginning	to	resent	the	generous	allotment	of	land	that	had	been	allocated	to	the	mission.

83	Although	the	Cerro	Negro	volcano	has	only	been	around	for	a	period	of	159	years,	it	has	erupted	at	least	23	times,	which	is	highly	active	compared	to	most	volcanoes.	This	historical	growth	of	the	volcano	has	allowed	for	documentation	of	the	growth	of	this	volcano	over	time.	It	was	discovered	that	the	timing	of	future	eruptions	is	correlated	with	the	volume	of	the	previous	significant	eruption.
