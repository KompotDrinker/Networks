<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This part of project presents a named entity recognition (NER) model for the identification of mountain names inside the texts.

<!-- SOLUTION -->
## Solution
This solution has implemented transformer-based named entity recognition model.

1. Firstly, prepeared data acquired from dataset and processed into vocabulary
2. Then, data is prepeared into batches
3. The model is created and compiled
4. Model training
5. Model testing
